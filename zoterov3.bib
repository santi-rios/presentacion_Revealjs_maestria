  abstract = {Earlier observations in neuroscience suggested that no new neurons form in the mature central nervous system. Evidence now indicates that new neurons do form in the adult mammalian brain. Two regions of the mature mammalian brain generate new neurons: (a) the border of the lateral ventricles of the brain (subventricular zone) and (b) the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review focuses only on new neuron formation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. During normal prenatal and early postnatal development, neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to differentiated neurons. NSCs persist in the dentate gyrus SGZ, undergoing cell division, with some daughter cells differentiating into functional neurons that participate in learning and memory and general cognition through integration into pre-existing neural networks. Axons, which emanate from neurons in the entorhinal cortex, synapse with dendrites of the granule cells (small neurons) of the dentate gyrus. Axons from granule cells synapse with pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA3 region, which send axons to synapse with CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells that send their axons out of the hippocampus proper. Adult neurogenesis includes proliferation, differentiation, migration, the death of some newly formed cells and final integration of surviving cells into neural networks. We summarise these processes in adult mammalian hippocampal neurogenesis and discuss the roles of major signalling molecules that influence neurogenesis, including neurotransmitters and some hormones. The recent controversy raised concerning whether or not adult neurogenesis occurs in humans also is discussed.},

  abstract = {Anxiety disorders may be mediated in part by disruptions in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system function. Behavioral measures of approach-avoidance conflict suggest that serotonin neurons within the median raphe nucleus (MRN) promote an anxiogenic state, and some evidence indicates this may be mediated by serotonergic signaling within the dorsal hippocampus. Here, we test this hypothesis using an optogenetic approach to examine the contribution of MRN 5-HT neurons and 5-HT innervation of the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) to anxiety-like behaviours in female mice. Mice expressing the excitatory opsin ChR2 were generated by crossing the ePet-cre serotonergic cre-driver line with the conditional Ai32 ChR2 reporter line, resulting in selective expression of ChR2 in 5-HT neurons. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that this approach enabled reliable optogenetic stimulation of MRN 5-HT neurons, and this stimulation produced downstream 5-HT release in the dHC as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Optogenetic stimulation of the MRN elicited behavioral responses indicative of an anxiogenic effect in three behavioural tests: novelty-suppressed feeding, marble burying and exploration on the elevated-plus maze. These effects were shown to be behaviourally-specific. Stimulation of 5-HT terminals in the dHC recapitulated the anxiety-like behaviour in the novelty-suppressed feeding and marble burying tests. These results show that activation of 5-HT efferents from the MRN rapidly induces expression of anxiety-like behaviour, in part via projections to the dHC. These findings reveal an important neural circuit implicated in the expression of anxiety in female mice.},

Hebb’s seminal work foreshadowed some of the great neuroscientific discoveries of the following decades, including the discovery of long-term potentiation and other lasting forms of synaptic plasticity, and more recently the residence of memories in synaptically connected neuronal assemblies. Our understanding of the processes underlying learning and memory has been dominated by the view that synapses are the principal site of information storage in the brain. This view has received substantial support from research in several model systems, with the vast majority of studies on the topic corroborating a role for synapses in memory storage. Yet, despite the neuroscience community’s best efforts, we are still without conclusive proof that memories reside at synapses. Furthermore, an increasing number of non-synaptic mechanisms have emerged that are also capable of acting as memory substrates. In this review, we address the key findings from the synaptic plasticity literature that make these phenomena such attractive memory mechanisms. We then turn our attention to evidence that questions the reliance of memory exclusively on changes at the synapse and attempt to integrate these opposing views.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal adult neurogenesis has been associated to many cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions and dysfunctions, and its status as a selected effect or an “appendix of the brain” has been debated. In this review, we propose to understand hippocampal neurogenesis as the process underlying the “Baldwin effect”, a particular situation in evolution where fitness does not rely on the natural selection of genetic traits, but on “ontogenetic adaptation” to a changing environment. This supports the view that a strong distinction between developmental and adult hippocampal neurogenesis is made. We propose that their functions are the constitution and the lifelong adaptation, respectively, of a basic repertoire of cognitive and emotional behaviors. This lifelong adaptation occurs through new forms of binding, i.e., association or dissociation of more basic elements. This distinction further suggests that a difference is made between developmental vulnerability (or resilience), stemming from dysfunctional (or highly functional) developmental hippocampal neurogenesis, and adult vulnerability (or resilience), stemming from dysfunctional (or highly functional) adult hippocampal neurogenesis. According to this hypothesis, developmental and adult vulnerability are distinct risk factors for various mental disorders in adults. This framework suggests new avenues for research on hippocampal neurogenesis and its implication in mental disorders.},

We examined whether anxiolytic effects of fluoxetine can be detected over three daily test sessions. We examined also whether repeated handling associated with chronic treatment interferes with effects of fluoxetine on anxiety responses. The 3D maze comprises nine arms, each connected to an upward inclined bridge radiating from a central platform. In this maze, BALB/c mice cross frequently into the bridges but avoid the arms. This avoidance is used as an index of anxiety. Two separate groups received once a day either saline (SALCH, n\,=\,8) or fluoxetine (FLUCH, n\,=\,8) for 14 days, and up to 30\,min before the test during the subsequent 3 days. A third group received saline (SALAC, n\,=\,8) 30\,min before the test, once a day for 3 days. SALAC mice did not cross into the arms, and continued this avoidance over 3 sessions. SALCH mice avoided the arms in session 1 whereas FLUCH mice did cross into the arms, and like SALCH mice, increased number of crossings into and time on the arms in subsequent sessions. Fluoxetine evidently had an anxiolytic effect but only in the first session. These results indicate that handling experience decreased fear and anxiety in the mice, which may have masked the anxiolytic effect of fluoxetine in the second and third test sessions.},

Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that Bax deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.},

  abstract = {Variations in people's vulnerability to stressful life events may rise from a predated neural sensitivity as well as from differential neural modifications in response to the event. Because the occurrence of a stressful life event cannot be foreseen, characterizing the temporal trajectory of its neural manifestations in humans has been a real challenge. The current prospective study examined the emotional experience and brain responses of 50 a priori healthy new recruits to the Israeli Defense Forces at 2 time points: before they entered their mandatory military service and after their subsequent exposure to stressful events while deployed in combat units. Over time, soldiers reported on increase in stress symptoms that was correlated with greater amygdala and hippocampus responsiveness to stress-related content. However, these closely situated core limbic regions exhibited different temporal trajectories with regard to the stress effect; whereas amygdala's reactivity before stress predicted the increase in stress symptoms, the hippocampal change in activation over time correlated with the increase in such symptoms. Hippocampal plasticity was also reflected by a modification over time of its functional coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and this coupling magnitude was again predicted by predated amygdala reactivity. Together, these findings suggest that variations in human's likelihood to develop symptomatic phenomena following stressful life events may depend on a balanced interplay between their amygda-la's predisposing reactivity and hippocampal posteriori intra-and interregional plasticity. Accordingly, an individually tailored therapeutic approach for trauma survivors should target these 2 neural probes while considering their unique temporal prints. individual differences prospective study fMRI trauma},

  abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is a neurogenic structure that exhibits functional and structural reorganization after injury. Neurogenesis and functional recovery occur after brain damage, and the possible relation between both processes is a matter of study. We explored whether neurogenesis and the activation of new neurons correlated with DG recovery over time. We induced a DG lesion in young adult rats through the intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and analyzed functional recovery and the activation of new neurons after animals performed a contextual fear memory task (CFM) or a control spatial exploratory task. We analyzed the number of BrdU+ cells that co-localized with doublecortin (DCX) or with NeuN within the damaged DG and evaluated the number of cells in each population that were labelled with the activity marker c-fos after either task. At 10~days post-lesion (dpl), a region of the granular cell layer was devoid of cells, evidencing the damaged area, whereas at 30~dpl this region was significantly smaller. At 10~dpl, the number of BrdU+/DCX+/c-fos positive cells was increased compared to the sham-lesion group, but CFM was impaired. At 30~dpl, a significantly greater number of BrdU+/NeuN+/c-fos positive cells was observed than at 10~dpl, and activation correlated with CFM recovery. Performance in the spatial exploratory task induced marginal c-fos immunoreactivity in the BrdU+/NeuN+ population. We demonstrate that neurons born after the DG was damaged survive and are activated in a time- and task-dependent manner and that activation of new neurons occurs along functional recovery.},

  abstract = {Episodic memory requires linking events in time, a function dependent on the hippocampus. In “trace” fear conditioning, animals learn to associate a neutral cue with an aversive stimulus despite their separation in time by a delay period on the order of tens of seconds. But how this temporal association forms remains unclear. Here we use 2-photon calcium imaging to track neural population dynamics over the complete time-course of learning and show that, in contrast to previous theories, the hippocampus does not generate persistent activity to bridge the time delay. Instead, learning is concomitant with broad changes in the active neural population in CA1. While neural responses were highly stochastic in time, cue identity could be reliably read out from population activity rates over longer timescales after learning. These results question the ubiquity of neural sequences during temporal association learning, and suggest that trace fear conditioning relies on mechanisms that differ from persistent activity accounts of working memory.},

As this continuous addition remodels hippocampal circuits, computational models predict that neurogenesis leads to degradation or forgetting of established memories.

By contrast, during infancy, when hippocampal neurogenesis levels are high and freshly generated memories tend to be rapidly forgotten (infantile amnesia), decreasing neurogenesis after memory formation mitigated forgetting. In precocial species, including guinea pigs and degus, most granule cells are generated prenatally. Consistent with reduced levels of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, infant guinea pigs and degus did not exhibit forgetting. However, increasing neurogenesis after memory formation induced infantile amnesia in these species.},

We reviewed how students and teachers have utilized ChatGPT in different educational settings and the main findings of those studies. The results of this review show that ChatGPT has helped students in their learning process as it served as a virtual intelligent assistant, facilitated learning approaches, and enhanced students' competencies and academic success. However, the results of specific studies (n=3, 21.4\%) show that overuse of ChatGPT may negatively impact innovative capacities and collaborative learning competencies among students. As for educators, ChatGPT has helped teachers enhance their productivity and efficiency and promoted different teaching methodologies. The majority of the reviewed studies have recommended that the effective utilization of ChatGPT in education requires well-structured training, support, and clear rules and regulations regarding its usage. Additionally, further research and engagement in discussions with policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners are needed.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) represent the most common treatment for major depression. However, their efficacy is variable and incomplete. In order to elucidate the cause of such incomplete efficacy, we explored the hypothesis positing that SSRIs may not affect mood per se but, by enhancing neural plasticity, render the individual more susceptible to the influence of the environment. Consequently, SSRI administration in a favorable environment promotes a reduction of symptoms, whereas in a stressful environment leads to a worse prognosis. To test such hypothesis, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to chronic stress in order to induce a depression-like phenotype and, subsequently, to fluoxetine treatment (21 days), while being exposed to either an enriched or a stressful condition. We measured the most commonly investigated molecular, cellular and behavioral endophenotypes of depression and SSRI outcome, including depression-like behavior, neurogenesis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity and long-term potentiation. Results showed that, in line with our hypothesis, the endophenotypes investigated were affected by the treatment according to the quality of the living environment. In particular, mice treated with fluoxetine in an enriched condition overall improved their depression-like phenotype compared with controls, whereas those treated in a stressful condition showed a distinct worsening. Our findings suggest that the effects of SSRI on the depression- like phenotype is not determined by the drug per se but is induced by the drug and driven by the environment. These findings may be helpful to explain variable effects of SSRI found in clinical practice and to device strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy by means of controlling environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Serotonin is probably best known for its role in conveying a sense of contentedness and happiness. It is one of the most unique and pharmacologically complex monoamines in both the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Serotonin has become in focus of interest for the treatment of depression with multiple serotonin-mimetic and modulators of adult neurogenesis used clinically. Here we will take a broad view of serotonin from development to its physiological role as a neurotransmitter and its contribution to homeostasis of the adult rodent hippocampus. This chapter reflects the most significant findings on cellular and molecular mechanisms from neuroscientists in the field over the last two decades. We illustrate the action of serotonin by highlighting basic receptor targeting studies, and how receptors impact brain function. We give an overview of recent genetically modified mouse models that differ in serotonin availability and focus on the role of the monoamine in antidepressant response. We conclude with a synthesis of the most recent data surrounding the role of serotonin in activity and hippocampal neurogenesis. This synopsis sheds light on the mechanisms and potential therapeutic model by which serotonin plays a critical role in the maintenance of mood.},

  abstract = {The NMDA receptor, which has been implicated in memory formation, is noncompetitively blocked by ketamine. The present study examines the effect of ketamine (0, 3, 6, 12, and 25 mg/kg body wt; ip) on tunnel maze and water maze performance in Wistar rats. In the hexagonal tunnel maze (HTM) high doses of ketamine (12 and 25 mg/kg) decreased locomotor activity. Moreover, ketamine induced perimeter walking (6, 12, and 25 mg/kg) and attenuated exploratory efficiency (25 mg/kg). When the HTM was converted into a modified six-arm radial maze, ketamine impaired short-term but not long-term memory. In the Morris water maze, rats injected with ketamine (12 and 25 mg/kg) acquired a spatial navigation task more slowly than controls. When the escape platform was removed, the drug-treated rats did not preferentially search for it in the area where the platform had been during the acquisition phase. However, when the escape platform was visible, no differences in the performance of ketaminetreated and control rats could be found. In summary, ketamine seems to attenuate some but not all forms of learning in the tunnel maze and it impairs the acquisition of a spatial navigation task. © 1989 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that exists at most synapses in the nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR). In this review, NMDAR-independent LTP of various areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems are discussed.},

Antidepressant-induced upregulation of BDNF signaling is thought to promote adaptive neuronal plasticity through effects on gene expression, but the effector genes downstream of BDNF has not been identified. Local infusion of BDNF into the dentate gyrus induces a long-term potentiation (BDNF-LTP) of synaptic transmission that requires upregulation of the immediate early gene Arc. Recently, we identified five genes (neuritin, Narp, TIEG1, Carp, and Arl4d) that are coupregulated with Arc during BDNF-LTP. Here, we examined the expression of these genes in the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, and prefrontal cortex after antidepressant treatment. We show that chronic, but not acute, fluoxetine administration leads to upregulation of these BDNF-LTP-associated genes in a brain region-specific pattern. These findings link chronic effects of antidepressant treatment to molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {In the autoradiograms of young rats injected with thymidine-H3 many of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus were found labeled. The number of labeled cells declined rapidly with increased age at the time of injection. Histological studies showed the presence in young rats of a large germinal matrix of mitotic cells in the ependymal and subependymal layers of the third and lateral ventricles. The areal extent and cell population of this germinal pool declined rapidly from birth on, with a transient rise with a peak at about 15 days. During this latter period the number of “undifferentiated” cells near the granular layer of the dentate gyrus showed a rapid rise with a subsequent decline. The decline in the number of “undifferentiated” cells was accompanied by a rise in the number of differentiated granule cells. Cell counts in homologous parts of the dentate gyrus indicated a six-fold increase in the number of differentiated granule cells from birth to three months. We postulated that undifferentiated cells migrate postnatally from the forebrain ventricles to the hippocampus where they become differentiated. The possible functional significance of delayed hippocampal neurogenesis is discussed with reference to our finding of incorporation of testosterone-H3 by cells of the hippocampus, implicating that they may function as receptors of gonadal hormones.},

  abstract = {Depression is a highly prevalent and recurrent neuropsychiatric disorder associated with alterations in emotional and cognitive domains. Neuroplastic phenomena are increasingly considered central to the etiopathogenesis of and recovery from depression. Nevertheless, a high number of remitted patients experience recurrent episodes of depression, remaining unclear how previous episodes impact on behavior and neuroplasticity and/or whether modulation of neuroplasticity is important to prevent recurrent depression. Through re-exposure to an unpredictable chronic mild stress protocol in rats, we observed the re-appearance of emotional and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, treatment with the antidepressants fluoxetine and imipramine was effective to promote sustained reversion of a depressive-like phenotype; however, their differential impact on adult hippocampal neuroplasticity triggered a distinct response to stress re-exposure: while imipramine re-established hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal dendritic arborization contributing to resilience to recurrent depressive-like behavior, stress re-exposure in fluoxetine-treated animals resulted in an overproduction of adult-born neurons along with neuronal atrophy of granule neurons, accounting for an increased susceptibility to recurrent behavioral changes typical of depression. Strikingly, cell proliferation arrest compromised the behavior resilience induced by imipramine and buffered the susceptibility to recurrent behavioral changes promoted by fluoxetine. This study shows that previous exposure to a depressive-like episode impacts on the behavioral and neuroanatomical changes triggered by subsequent re-exposure to similar experimental conditions and reveals that the proper control of adult hippocampal neuroplasticity triggered by antidepressants is essential to counteract recurrent depressive-like episodes.},

  abstract = {Background ChatGPT has emerged as a valuable tool for enhancing scientific writing. It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers’ workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences. Method The search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPT’s use in scientific research. Results The majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPT’s performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as “hallucinations.” Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries. Conclusion ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity.},

This review aims at synthesizing information about differential effects of antidepressants on cognitive function to facilitate good prescription. The first part of this review tries to summarize the main tasks used to explore global reactivity, attention, memory and psychomotor performances. The second part of this work presents the differential cognitive effects of antidepressants with a discrimination between substances which have a sedative impact, antidepressants with no cognitive effect, and drugs which seem to have a positive cognitive action. The differenciation is established for single and repeated administration, for healthy volunteers and depressed subjects. For each substance, the dose, the tasks selected and cognitive effect are discussed and the question of the real benefit of this cognitive impact is raised. The specificity of cognitive effects of antidepressants related to age and to the combination with alcohol are also tackled. Then the discussion raises the difficulty and the biases encountered to perform neuropsychological studies and particularly evaluation of cognitive effects of antidepressants. Finally the conclusion of this review gives some advice to select and prescribe antidepressants according to their cognitive effects.},

  abstract = {Objective Brain structural changes in schizoaffective disorder, and how far they resemble those seen in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, have only been studied to a limited extent. Method Forty-five patients meeting DSM-IV and RDC criteria for schizoaffective disorder, groups of patients with 45 matched schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and 45 matched healthy controls were examined using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Results Analyses comparing each patient group with the healthy control subjects found that the patients with schizoaffective disorder and the patients with schizophrenia showed widespread and overlapping areas of significant volume reduction, but the patients with bipolar disorder did not. A subsequent analysis compared the combined group of patients with the controls followed by extraction of clusters. In regions where the patients differed significantly from the controls, no significant differences in mean volume between patients with schizoaffective disorder and patients with schizophrenia in any of five regions of volume reduction were found, but mean volumes in the patients with bipolar disorder were significantly smaller in three of five. Conclusion The findings provide evidence that, in terms of structural gray matter brain abnormality, schizoaffective disorder resembles schizophrenia more than bipolar disorder.},

  abstract = {The morphology of neurons in the “hilar region” of the hippocampus (fields CA3c and CA4 of Lorente de Nó, '34) was analyzed with several variants of the Golgi technique. Hippocampi were dissected from the brains of 28-day-old rats, fixed and impregnated by immersion, and sectioned perpendicular to the long axis. Based on the resident cell types, aspects of the neuropil, and published data related to afferent termination, the area under study was divided into four zones. At least 21 cell types were observed throughout these zones, several of which had not previously been described. Many cells in this area exhibited an impressive number and variety of dendritic and axonal appendages, including spines on the proximal portion of some axons. The close apposition of fibers to these axonal spines suggested the possibility of axo-axonal interactions. The influence of dentate granule cells, through their mossy fibers, on the synaptic economy of the “hilar region” was found to be more extensive than previously reported. Mossy fibers appeared to terminate on the dendrites of several types of non-pyramidal cells, which bear no thorny excrescences, by means of thin filiform extensions which emanate from the mossy fiber expansions and by means of thin mossy fiber collaterals which are devoid of typical expansions. Consideration is given to a long-standing debate as to whether the deep “hilar region” (CA4 of Lorente de Nó, '34, hilus of the fascia dentata of Blackstad, '56) is related more to the hippocampus or to the fascia dentata and it is concluded that the deep hilar region is an area of mergence of the polymorphic zones of these two cortical structures. The results of the present study do not support the proposition that the deep hilar region is an extension of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus as suggested by Lorente de Nó ('34), and thus CA4 is a misnomer. Rather, the cells in this area are most closely related to the fascia dentata and should thus be considered to lie in the polymorphic zone of “area dentata” as proposed initially by Blackstad ('56).},

  abstract = {Exposure to elevated doses of ionizing radiation, such as those in therapeutic procedures, catastrophic accidents, or space exploration, increases the risk of cognitive dysfunction. The full range of radiation-induced cognitive deficits is unknown, partly because commonly used tests may be insufficiently sensitive or may not be adequately tuned for assessing the fine behavioral features affected by radiation. Here, we asked whether γ-radiation might affect learning, memory, and the overall ability to adapt behavior to cope with a challenging environment (cognitive/behavioral flexibility). We developed a new behavioral assay, the context discrimination Morris water maze (cdMWM) task, which is hippocampus-dependent and requires the integration of various contextual cues and the adjustment of search strategies. We exposed male mice to 1 or 5 Gy of γ rays and, at different time points after irradiation, trained them consecutively in spatial MWM, reversal MWM, and cdMWM tasks, and assessed their learning, navigational search strategies, and memory. Mice exposed to 5 Gy performed successfully in the spatial and reversal MWM tasks; however, in the cdMWM task 6 or 8 weeks (but not 3 weeks) after irradiation, they demonstrated transient learning deficit, decreased use of efficient spatially precise search strategies during learning, and, 6 weeks after irradiation, memory deficit. We also observed impaired neurogenesis after irradiation and selective activation of 12-week-old newborn neurons by specific components of cdMWM training paradigm. Thus, our new behavioral paradigm reveals the effects of γ-radiation on cognitive flexibility and indicates an extended timeframe for the functional maturation of new hippocampal neurons. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Exposure to radiation can affect cognitive performance and cognitive flexibility — the ability to adapt to changed circumstances and demands. The full range of consequences of irradiation on cognitive flexibility is unknown, partly because of a lack of suitable models. Here, we developed a new behavioral task requiring mice to combine various types of cues and strategies to find a correct solution. We show that animals exposed to γ-radiation, despite being able to successfully solve standard problems, show delayed learning, deficient memory, and diminished use of efficient navigation patterns in circumstances requiring adjustments of previously used search strategies. This new task could be applied in other settings for assessing the cognitive changes induced by aging, trauma, or disease.},

  abstract = {Aging is associated with impairments in learning, memory, and cognitive flexibility, as well as a gradual decline in hippocampal neurogenesis. We investigated the performance of 6-and 14-month-old mice (considered mature adult and late middle age, respectively) in learning and memory tasks based on the Morris water maze (MWM) and determined their levels of preceding and current neurogenesis. While both age groups successfully performed in the spatial version of MWM (sMWM), the older mice were less efficient compared to the younger mice when presented with modified versions of the MWM that required a reassessment of the previously acquired experience. This was detected in the reversal version of MWM (rMWM) and was particularly evident in the context discrimination MWM (cdMWM), a novel task that required integrating various distal cues, local cues, and altered contexts and adjusting previously used search strategies. Older mice were impaired in several metrics that characterize rMWM and cdMWM, however, they showed improvement and narrowed the performance gap with the younger mice after additional training. Furthermore, we analyzed the adult-born mature and immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and found a significant correlation between neurogenesis levels in individual mice and their performance in the tasks demanding cognitive flexibility. These results provide a detailed description of the age-related changes in learning and memory and underscore the importance of hippocampal neurogenesis in supporting cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract = {Shape is data and data is shape. Biologists are accustomed to thinking about how the shape of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms arise from the effects of genetics, development, and the environment. Less often do we consider that data itself has shape and structure, or that it is possible to measure the shape of data and analyze it. Here, we review applications of topological data analysis (TDA) to biology in a way accessible to biologists and applied mathematicians alike. TDA uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in data sets. Using a function that relates the similarity of data points to each other, we can monitor the evolution of topological features—connected components, loops, and voids. This evolution, a topological signature, concisely summarizes large, complex data sets. We first provide a TDA primer for biologists before exploring the use of TDA across biological sub-disciplines, spanning structural biology, molecular biology, evolution, and development. We end by comparing and contrasting different TDA approaches and the potential for their use in biology. The vision of TDA, that data are shape and shape is data, will be relevant as biology transitions into a data-driven era where the meaningful interpretation of large data sets is a limiting factor.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission, particularly via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, is involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Several studies have revealed an altered expression of NMDA receptor subtypes and impaired NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular signaling pathways in brain circuits of patients with MDD. Clinical studies have demonstrated that NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly ketamine, have rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression, however, neurobiological mechanisms are not completely understood. Growing body of evidence suggest that signal transduction pathways involved in synaptic plasticity play critical role in molecular mechanisms underlying rapidly acting antidepressant properties of ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists in MDD. Discovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique antidepressant actions of ketamine will facilitate the development of novel fast acting antidepressants which lack undesirable effects of ketamine. This review provides a critical examination of the NMDA receptor involvement in the neurobiology of MDD including analyses of alterations in NMDA receptor subtypes and their interactive signaling cascades revealed by postmortem studies. Furthermore, to elucidate mechanisms underlying rapid-acting antidepressant properties of NMDA receptor antagonists we discussed their effects on the neuroplasticity, mostly based on signaling systems involved in synaptic plasticity of mood-related neurocircuitries.},

The aim of this systematic review was to identify the alterations of the gut microbiota patterns in people with depression compared to healthy controls. A comprehensive literature search of human studies, published between January 2000 and June 2019, was reviewed. The key words included gastrointestinal microbiome, gut microbiome, microbiota, depression, depressive symptoms, and depressive disorder. The systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Disparities in a-diversity and b-diversity of the microbiota existed in people with depression compared to healthy controls. At the phylum level, there were inconsistencies in the abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. However, high abundance in Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria phyla were observed in people with depression. On the family level, high abundance of Actinomycineae, Coriobacterineae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Clostridiales incertae sedis XI, Porphyromonadaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Streptococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Thermoanaerobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Nocardiaceae, Streptomycetaceae, and low abundance of Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Sutterellaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Marniabilaceae, and Chitinophagaceae were observed in people with depression. On the genus level, high abundance of Oscillibacter, Blautia, Holdemania, Clostridium XIX, Anaerostipes, Anaerofilum, Streptococcus, Gelria, Turicibacter, Parabacteroides, Eggerthella, Klebsiella, Paraprevotella, Veillonella, Clostridium IV, Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis, Eubacterium, Parvimonas, Desulfovibrio, Parasutterella, Actinomyces, Asaccharobacter, Atopobium, Olsenella and low abundance of Coprococcus, Lactobacillus, Escherichia/ Shigella, Clostridium XlVa, Dialister, Howardella, Pyramidobacter, and Sutterella were found in people with depression. Alteration of gut microbiome patterns was evident in people with depression. Further evidence is warranted to allow for the translation of microbiome findings toward innovative clinical strategies that may improve treatment outcomes in people with depression.},

Such improved cognitive flexibility may in turn help to decrease anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviour.},

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces cognitive deficits clinically and in animal models. Learning and memory testing is critical when evaluating potential therapeutic strategies and treatments to manage the effects of TBI. We evaluated three data analysis methods for the Morris water maze (MWM), a learning and memory assessment widely used in the neurotrauma field, to determine which statistical tool is optimal for MWM data. Hidden platform spatial MWM data aggregated from three separate experiments from the same laboratory were analyzed using 1) a logistic regression model, 2) an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, and 3) an accelerated failure time (AFT) time-to-event model. The logistic regression model showed no significant evidence of differences between treatments among any swims over all days of the study, p\,{$>$}\,0.11. Although the ANOVA model found significant evidence of differences between sham and TBI groups on three out of four swims on the third day, results are potentially biased due to the failure of this model to account for censoring. The time-to-event AFT model showed significant differences between sham and TBI over all swims on the third day, p\,{$<$}\,0.045, taking censoring into account. We suggest AFT models should be the preferred analytical methodology for latency to platform associated with MWM studies.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Affective states are known to influence behaviour in humans resulting in cognitive affective biases, which may play an important role in the development and treatment of mood disorders. Similar biases have recently been shown in animals, including the rat, providing an opportunity to investigate these processes in non-human species. Objective: This study sought to investigate the psychopharmacology of cognitive affective bias in rats using systemic treatments with anxiolytic (diazepam) and antidepressant drugs (reboxetine or fluoxetine). Methods: Lister hooded rats were trained to discriminate two distinct tones and respond on the appropriate lever to either obtain reward (food) or avoid punishment (mild foot shock). Cognitive affective bias, following acute or chronic drug treatment, was investigated using test sessions where both reference tones and intermediate ambiguous tones were included. Results: Rats exhibited a negative judgement bias under vehicle conditions which was not significantly attenuated by any of the acute drug treatments, diazepam (0.3, 1.0 mg/kg), reboxetine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) or fluoxetine 0.1-1.0 mg/kg). Acute reboxetine induced a significant and dose-dependent decrease in the anticipation of reward. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine tended to reduce the negative bias observed in the rats after 1 week of treatment although no significant main effect of treatment was observed. Conclusions: The results from these initial psychopharmacological studies show that drug treatments can differentially affect motivation to respond to cues associated with reward versus punishment. Our data also suggest that cognitive affective bias, quantified using this method, may be sensitive to chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Depression is conventionally viewed as a state of chemical imbalance, and antidepressants are suggested to act through increasing monoaminergic neurotransmission. These views are currently considered simplistic. This article examines the animal and human literature on the neurohistological mechanisms underlying stress, depression and antidepressant treatment. Pathological stress and depression are associated with changes such as loss of dendritic spines, shrinkage of the dendritic tree and loss of synapses in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. There is also a decrease in glia. Apoptosis may occur under extreme circumstances. In contrast, there is increased dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis in the amygdala. Antidepressant treatment protects against and even reverses some but not all of these stress-induced neurohistological changes. Pathological stress results in an aberrant neuroplasticity response characterized by abnormally increased activity in the amygdala and by impaired functioning of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and downstream structures. This aberrant neuroplasticity response directly explains most of the clinical symptoms of depression. Antidepressant treatment protects against stress-induced pathoplastic neurohistological and neurocognitive changes. Antidepressant treatment also restores functional neuroplasticity in stressed organisms and, thereby, presumably, facilitates re-adaptation through learning and memory mechanisms. Thus, the stress-depression syndrome and the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of antidepressant treatments can be explained through a hardwiring analogy. In this context, glutamate is an important neurotransmitter.},

The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a “barren” regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.},

  abstract = {Depression treatment with antidepressants is generally described as evidence-based. However, generalizations to practice recommendations seem to us to rest on the tacit assumption that treatment outcome in research trials is the sum of three factors: specific effects of the drug, expectancy effects (placebo), and spontaneous recovery. Because randomization isolates the specific effects of the drug, trials showing significant drug effects are used as evidence for prescribing the drug regardless of context. Drawing on Wampold's (2001) description of two metamodels of psychotherapy, the authors argue that available empirical evidence indicates that depression treatment with antidepressants is primarily a psychological treatment. This conclusion has far-reaching consequences for the scientific status of contemporary treatments for depression. It also affects what the doctor should focus on in a treatment with antidepressants and how to act when the patient is treatment resistant. In order to achieve the results obtained in clinical trials, the quantity and quality of support from the doctor is more important than pharmacological concerns, such as adequate doses of medicine. When faced with a treatment resistant patient, relationship factors rather than pharmacological factors should be in focus. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

One of their important applications is the development of genetically engineered biosensor systems to investigate the processes occurring in living cells in real time. Today, there are fluorescence protein based sensory systems for detecting various substances in living cells (for example, hydrogen peroxide, ATP, Ca2+ etc.) or for detecting processes such as endoplasmic reticulum stress. Such systems help to study mechanisms underlying the pathogenic processes and diseases and for screening potential therapeutic compounds. It is also necessary to develop new tools for processing and analysis of obtained microimages. Here we present our web-application CellCountCV for automation of microscopy cell images analysis which is based on fully-convolutional deep neural networks. This approach can efficiently deal with non-convex overlapping objects, that are virtually inseparable with conventional image processing methods. The cell counts predicted with CellCountCV were very close to expert estimates (the average error rate was {$<$} 4\%). CellCountCV was used to analyse large series of microscopy images obtained in experimental studies and it was able to demonstrate the endoplasmic reticulum stress development and to catch the dose-dependent effect of tunicamycin.},

Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is currently the most commonly used, reliable, and effective rodent model of depression. However, for unclear reasons, this protocol is often difficult to reproduce in different laboratories. We performed a meta-analysis of studies that used the CUMS paradigm to evaluate depressive-like behavior in rodents. We sought to identify strain-dependent susceptibility to stress based on the development of one of the main end points of the model, “anhedonia.” The meta-analysis indicated that the CUMS protocol is a robust animal model of depression and is strongly associated with anhedonic behavior in rodents. However, high heterogeneity was found in the single subgroup analysis, which was attributable to modification of the CUMS and sucrose preference protocols. This may explain difficulties in reproducing stress protocols by different research groups.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Hippocampal neurogenesis continues throughout life and has been suggested to play an essential role in maintaining spatial cognitive function under physiological conditions. An increasing amount of evidence has indicated that adult neurogenesis is tightly controlled by environmental conditions in the neurogenic niche, which consists of multiple types of cells including microglia and astrocytes. Microglia maintain the environment of neurogenic niche through their phagocytic capacity and interaction with neurons via fractalkine‐CX3CR1 signaling. In addition, microglia release growth factors such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐α to support the development of adult born neurons. Astrocytes also manipulate neurogenesis by releasing various soluble factors including adenosine triphosphate and lactate. Whereas, under pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, and epilepsy, microglia and astrocytes play a leading role in inflammation and are involved in attenuating the normal process of neurogenesis. The modulation of glial functions on neurogenesis in these brain diseases are attracting attention as a new therapeutic target. This review describes how these glial cells play a role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in both health and disease, especially focusing glia‐derived factors.},

Experimental Approach                                S‐Ketamine (15~mg·kg                 −1                 ) or saline was administered as a single injection to Flinders Line (FSL/ FRL) rats. Twenty‐four hours after the treatment, perfusion fixation was carried out and the morphology of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)‐positive astrocytes in the CA1 stratum radiatum (CA1.SR) and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GCL) of the hippocampus was investigated by applying stereological techniques and analysis with Imaris software.

Key Results               FSL rats treated with ketamine exhibited a significant reduction in immobility time in comparison with the FSL‐vehicle group. The volumes of the hippocampal CA1.SR and GCL regions were significantly increased 1~day after ketamine treatment in the FSL rats. The size of astrocytes in the ketamine‐treated FSL rats was larger than those in the FSL‐vehicle group. Additionally, the number and length of the astrocytic processes in the CA1.SR region were significantly increased 1~day following ketamine treatment.

AlphaStar draws on many areas of AI research, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and evolutionary computation (EC). In this paper we analyze AlphaStar primarily through the lens of EC, presenting a new look at the system and relating it to many concepts in the field. We highlight some of its most interesting aspects---the use of Lamarckian evolution, competitive co-evolution, and quality diversity. In doing so, we hope to provide a bridge between the wider EC community and one of the most significant AI systems developed in recent times.},

Based on previous guidelines and new suggestions, we present a set of focused and detailed standards for reporting the methods used in a literature search. The guidelines cover five search strategies: reference database searches, journal and bibliography searches, searches of the reference lists of reports, citation searches, and direct contact searches. First, we bring together all the unique recommendations made in existing guidelines for research synthesis. Second, we identify gaps in reporting standards for search strategies. Third, we address these gaps by providing new reporting recommendations. Our hope is to facilitate successful evaluation and replication of research synthesis results.

  abstract = {Neuronal migration is a critical process in the development of the nervous system. Defects in the migration of the neurons are associated with diseases like lissencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), and pachygyria. Doublecortin (DCX) is an essential factor in neurogenesis and mutations in this protein impairs neuronal migration leading to several pathological conditions. Although, DCX is capable of modulating and stabilizing microtubules (MTs) to ensure effective migration, the mechanisms involved in executing these functions remain poorly understood. Meanwhile, there are existing gaps regarding the processes that underlie tumor initiation and progression into cancer as well as the ability to migrate and invade normal cells. Several studies suggest that DCX is involved in cancer metastasis. Unstable interactions between DCX and MTs destabilizes cytoskeletal organization leading to disorganized movements of cells, a process which may be implicated in the uncontrolled migration of cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is complex and require further clarification. Therefore, exploring the importance and features known up to date about this molecule will broaden our understanding and shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for the associated neurological diseases. This review summarizes current knowledge about DCX, its features, functions, and relationships with other proteins. We also present an overview of its role in cancer cells and highlight the importance of studying its gene mutations.},

Synaptic plasticity consists of gradual changes in the biochemistry and morphology of pre‐ and postsynaptic neurons, particularly in the hippocampus.

Given the increasing use of cannabis, mainly among the young population, plus its potential adverse long‐term effects on learning and memory processes, it could be a future global health challenge. Indeed, the impact of cannabinoids on memory is multifactorial and depends on the dosage, timing, formula, and route of consumption, plus the background complex interaction of the endocannabinoids system with other cerebral networks.

The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves.}

The present study revealed that increased production of TGF-β1 in transgenic mice resulted in gliosis at young ages. In addition, the increased TGF-β1 augmented the expression of some key subunits of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with TGF-β1 facilitated neurite outgrowth and enhanced glutamate-evoked currents.

In the first experiment, the authors administered intraperitoneal injections of contrast medium using either technique and then used micro-computed tomography to evaluate the placement and retention of the medium. In the second and third experiments, the authors administered intraperitoneal injections or control treatments, then sampled blood to determine circulating concentrations of stress-related hormones. Imaging showed that both the novel and the conventional techniques properly delivered a contrast medium into the peritoneal cavity. The novel technique was also associated with lower concentrations of stress-related hormones than was the conventional technique.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. However, the time window for quickly dissolving clots and restoring cerebral  blood flow, using tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment is rather limited,  resulting in many patients experiencing long-term functional impairments if not  death. This study aims to determine the roles of cranial bone transport (CBT), a  novel, effective, and simple surgical technique, in the recovery of ischemic  stroke using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. METHODS: CBT was  performed by slowly sliding a bone segment in skull with a special frame and a  speed of 0.25 mm/12 hours for 10 days following MCAO. Morris water maze, rotarod  test, and catwalk gait analysis were used to study the neurological behaviors,  and infarct area and cerebral flow were evaluated during CBT process.  Immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and Nestin/Sox2 (sex determining region Y box  2) was performed to study the angiogenesis and neurogenesis. OVA-A647  (ovalbumin-Alexa Fluor 647) was intracisterna magna injected to evaluate the  meningeal lymphatic drainage function. RESULTS: CBT treatment has significantly  reduced the ischemic lesions areas and improved the neurological deficits in MCAO  rats compared with the rats in the control groups. CBT treatment significantly  promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain of MCAO rats. The drainage  function of meningeal lymphatic vessels in MCAO rats was significantly impaired  compared with normal rats. Ablation of meningeal lymphatic drainage led to  increased neuroinflammation and aggravated neurological deficits and ischemic  injury in MCAO rats. CBT treatment significantly improved the meningeal lymphatic  drainage function and alleviated T-cell infiltration in MCAO rats. CONCLUSIONS:  This study provided evidence for the possible mechanisms on how CBT attenuates  ischemic stroke injury and facilitates rapid neuronal function recovery,  suggesting that CBT may be an alternative treatment strategy for managing  ischemic stroke.},

Storage of the long-term memory for sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia has been extensively studied in this respect and is associated with the growth of new synapses by the sensory neurons onto their postsynaptic target neurons. Recent time-lapse imaging studies of living sensory-to-motor neuron synapses in culture have monitored both functional and structural changes simultaneously so as to follow remodeling and growth at the same specific synaptic connections continuously over time and to examine the functional contribution of these learning-related structural changes to the different timedependent phases of memory storage. Insights provided by these studies suggest the synaptic differentiation and growth induced by learning in the mature nervous system are highly dynamic and often rapid processes that can recruit both molecules and mechanisms used for de novo synapse formation during development.},

  abstract = {The manner in which laboratory rodents are housed is driven by economics (minimal use of space and resources), ergonomics (ease of handling and visibility of animals), hygiene, and standardization (reduction of variation). This has resulted in housing conditions that lack sensory and motor stimulation and restrict the expression of species-typical behavior. In mice, such housing conditions have been associated with indicators of impaired welfare, including abnormal repetitive behavior (stereotypies, compulsive behavior), enhanced anxiety and stress reactivity, and thermal stress. However, due to concerns that more complex environmental conditions might increase variation in experimental results, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of environmental enrichment beyond the provision of nesting material. Here, using 96 C57BL/6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies: (1) bedding alone; (2) bedding + nesting material; (3) deeper bedding + nesting material + shelter + increased vertical space; and (4) semi-naturalistic conditions, including weekly changes of enrichment items. We studied how these different forms of environmental enrichment affected measures of animal welfare, including home-cage behavior (time–budget and stereotypic behavior), anxiety (open field behavior, elevated plus-maze behavior), growth (food and water intake, body mass), stress physiology (glucocorticoid metabolites in fecal boluses and adrenal mass), brain function (recurrent perseveration in a two-choice guessing task) and emotional valence (judgment bias). Our results highlight the difficulty in making general recommendations across common strains of mice and for selecting enrichment strategies within specific strains. Overall, the greatest benefit was observed in animals housed with the greatest degree of enrichment. Thus, in the super-enriched housing condition, stereotypic behavior, behavioral measures of anxiety, growth and stress physiology varied in a manner consistent with improved animal welfare compared to the other housing conditions with less enrichment. Similar to other studies, we found no evidence, in the measures assessed here, that environmental enrichment increased variation in experimental results.},

When investigators wish to report effect sizes derived from analyses of variance that include repeated measures, past advice has been problematic. Only recently has a generally useful effect size statistic been proposed for such designs: generalized eta squared (ηG2; Olejnik \& Algina, 2003). Here, we present this method, explain that ηG2is preferred to eta squared and partial eta squared because it provides comparability across between-subjects and within-subjects designs, show that it can easily be computed from information provided by standard statistical packages, and recommend that investigators provide it routinely in their research reports when appropriate.},

Published studies of rats, mice and other rodents were reviewed to document behavioural and psychological problems attributable to predominant laboratory housing conditions. Studies indicate that rats and mice value opportunities to take cover, build nests, explore, gain social contact, and exercise some control over their social milieu, and that the inability to satisfy these needs is physically and psychologically detrimental, leading to impaired brain development and behavioural anomalies (e.g. stereotypies). To the extent that space is a means to gain access to such resources, spatial confinement likely exacerbates these deficits. Adding environmental 'enrichments' to small cages reduces but does not eliminate these problems, and I argue that substantial changes in housing and husbandry conditions would be needed to further reduce them. © Laboratory Animals Ltd.},

Preclinical studies have provided valuable insights into pathogenesis of radiation-induced injury to the central nervous system. Radiation-induced brain injury can damage neuronal, glial and vascular compartments of the brain and may lead to molecular, cellular and functional changes. Given its central role in memory and adult neurogenesis, the majority of studies have focused on the hippocampus. These findings suggested that hippocampal avoidance in cranial radiotherapy prevents radiation-induced cognitive impairment of patients. However, multiple rodent studies have shown that this problem is more complex. As the radiation-induced cognitive impairment reflects hippocampal and non-hippocampal compartments, it is of critical importance to investigate molecular, cellular and functional modifications in various brain regions as well as their integration at clinically relevant doses and schedules. We here provide a literature overview, including our previously published results, in order to support the translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice, and improve the physical and mental status of patients with brain tumors.},

Following trypsinization the cells are plated out at low density on polylysine-treated coverslips in an enriched medium. The isolated neurons rapidly attach to the substrate and initiate process extension. Little reaggregation occurs and the number of non-neuronal cells present is minimal. Unless co-cultured with tissue explants the neurons survive for only a few days; in the presence of hippocampal explants the initial growth of the isolated cells is improved and their survival in culture is extended to about two weeks. Some of the cells in such cultures develop a characteristic branching pattern closely resembling that of maturing hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo. There is a clear relationship between the stage of the cells' development and their growth in culture. Cells which had completed DNA synthesis about 48 h before dissociation, and which were in the process of migration to the cortical plate, survived best in our cultures. Early post-mitotic cells which were still within the ventricular zone and cells which had already reached the cortical plate grew poorly. This system should permit the study not only of process formation by these cells, but also of their capacity to form specific synapses in vitro and of the biochemical constituents of their surfaces.},

The hippocampal formation, one of the main targets of these investigations, holds a neurogenic niche widely recognized among several mammalian species and whose existence in the human brain has sparked controversy and extensive debate. Many cellular features from this region emphasize that hippocampal neurogenesis suffers changes with normal aging and, among regulatory factors, physical exercise and chronic stress provoke opposite effects on cell proliferation, maturation, and survival. Considering the numerous functions attributable to the hippocampal formation, increasing or decreasing the integration of new neurons in the delicate neuronal network might be significant for modulation of cognition and emotion. The role that immature and mature adult-born neurons play in this circuitry is still mostly unknown but it could prove fundamental to understand hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes, the pathophysiology of depression, and the therapeutic effects of antidepressant medication in modulating behavior and mental health.},

Our review begins with a survey of species that show evidence of adult neurogenesis. We then discuss how neurogenesis varies across brain regions and point out that regional specializations can indicate functional adaptations. Lifespan and aging are key life-history traits. Whereas ‘adult neurogenesis’ is the common term in the literature, it does not reflect the reality of neurogenesis being primarily a ‘juvenile’ phenomenon. We discuss the sharp decline with age as a universal trait of neurogenesis with inevitable functional consequences. Finally, the main body of the review focuses on the function of neurogenesis in birds and mammals. Selected examples illustrate how our understanding of avian and mammalian neurogenesis can complement each other. It is clear that although the two phyla have some common features, the function of adult neurogenesis may not be similar between them and filling the gaps will help us understand neurogenesis as an evolutionarily conserved trait to meet particular ecological pressures.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex illness that is arising as a growing public health concern. Although several brain areas are related to this type of disorders, at the cellular level, the parvalbumin-positive cells of the hippocampus interplay a very relevant role. They control pyramidal cell bursts, neuronal networks, basic microcircuit functions, and other complex neuronal tasks involved in mood disorders. In resistant depressions, the efficacy of current antidepressant treatments drops dramatically, so the new rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs) are being postulated as novel treatments. Ketamine at subanesthetic doses and its derivative metabolites have been proposed as RAADs due to their rapid and sustained action by blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which in turn lead to the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This mechanism produces a rapid plasticity activation mediated by neurotransmitter homeostasis, synapse recovery, and increased dendritic spines and therefore, it is a promising therapeutic approach to improve cognitive symptoms in MDD.},

In eutherians, most brain structures develop embryonically; conversely, in marsupials, a number of brain structures develop after birth. The exception is the generation of granule cells in the dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum of eutherian species. The formation of these structures starts during embryogenesis and continues postnatally. In both eutherians and marsupials, neurogenesis continues in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation throughout life. The majority of proliferated cells from the SVZ migrate to the olfactory bulb, whereas, in the dentate gyrus, cells reside within this structure after division and differentiation into neurons. A key aim of this review is to evaluate advances in understanding developmental neurogenesis that occurs postnatally in both marsupials and eutherians, with a particular emphasis on the generation of granule cells during the formation of the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum. We debate the significance of immature neurons in the piriform cortex of young mammals. We also synthesize the knowledge of adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of marsupials by considering whether adult-born neurons are essential for the functioning of a given area.},

This European, cross-sectional, naturalistic multicenter study investigated the frequency of additional psychotherapy in terms of a manual-driven psychotherapy (MDP) in 1410 adult in- and outpatients with MDD, who were primarily treated with AD psychopharmacotherapy. Socio-demographic and clinical patterns were compared between patients receiving both treatments and those lacking concomitant MDP. In a total of 1279 MDD patients (90.7\%) with known status of additional MDP, those undergoing a psychopharmacotherapy-MDP combination (31.2\%) were younger, higher educated, more often employed and less severely ill with lower odds for suicidality as compared to patients receiving exclusively psychopharmacotherapy (68.8\%). They experienced an earlier mean age of MDD onset, melancholic features, comorbid asthma and migraine and received lower daily doses of their first-line ADs. While agomelatine was more often established in these patients, MDD patients without MDP received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors more frequently. These two patient groups did not differ in terms of response, non-response and treatment resistant depression (TRD). Accordingly, the employment of additional MDP could not be related to better treatment outcomes in MDD. The fact that MDP was applied in a minority of patients with rather beneficial socio-demographic and clinical characteristics might reflect inferior accessibility of these psychotherapeutic techniques for socially and economically disadvantaged populations.},

This affection can be observed in acute neurological disorders such as ischaemia, limbic encephalitis, hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and transient global amnesia. The basis of this regional susceptibility is, however, only partly understood but may include genetically-determined, glutamate-dependent, and calcium-mediated mechanisms of neuronal excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Additionally, inflammatory responses and immunologically-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the response to acute metabolic stress but may also be involved in ageing and neurodegenerative disorders. The structure–function relationship of the hippocampus in pathological states can be monitored in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, the cellular and imaging correlates and pattern of hippocampal damage is reviewed in terms of studying the evolution and sequelae of hippocampal CA1 diffusion and ADC changes in acute neurological disorders. The evolution of diffusion changes over the course of the disease show that CA1 diffusion lesions can be most prominently detected within the first 3 days after the injury, frequently leading to a ‘delayed neuronal death’ of CA1 neurons. The cellular correlates of hippocampal damage, as reflected by MRI are incorporated into a pathophysiological framework highlighting the clinical neurobiology of the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Initiation of ketamine use often occurs in adolescence, yet little is known about long-term consequences when use begins in this developmental period. The current experiments were designed to examine the effects of repeated exposure to ketamine in adolescence on behavior in adulthood. We examined locomotor activity, as well as cognitive function, in animals that received repeated administration of ketamine. Groups of adolescent and adult male rats were treated with ketamine (25 mg/kg)once daily for 10 days. Locomotor activity was assessed following the first injection, following 10 days of injection, and following 20 days of abstinence. Acute locomotor effects and locomotor sensitization were compared in adolescents and adults; cross-sensitization to dextromethorphan, another dissociative with abusive potential, was also examined. In a separate group of animals cognitive deficits were assessed following the 20 day abstinence period in spatial learning and novel object recognition tasks. The locomotor stimulant effect of ketamine was much greater in adolescents than adults. Animals that were repeatedly administered ketamine demonstrated locomotor sensitization immediately after the final injection. However, sensitization only persisted after the abstinence period in animals treated as adults. No cross-sensitization to dextromethorphan was evident. Ketamine failed to produce statistically significant cognitive deficits in either age group, although drug-treated adults showed a trend towards deficits in spatial learning. Repeated use of ketamine produces long-lasting neuroadaptations that may contribute to addiction. Mild lasting memory deficits may occur in adults, although further work is necessary to confirm these findings. The results extend the understanding of potential long-term consequences of ketamine use in adolescents and adults.},

  abstract = {The precise patterns of neuronal assembly during development determine all functional outputs of a nervous system; these may range from simple reflexes to learning, memory, cognition, etc. To understand how brain functions and how best to repair it after injury, disease, or trauma, it is imperative that we first seek to define fundamental steps mediating this neuronal assembly. To acquire the sophisticated ensemble of highly specialized networks seen in a mature brain, all proliferated and migrated neurons must extend their axonal and dendritic processes toward targets, which are often located at some distance. Upon contact with potential partners, neurons must undergo dramatic structural changes to become either a pre- or a postsynaptic neuron. This connectivity is cemented through specialized structures termed synapses. Both structurally and functionally, the newly formed synapses are, however, not static as they undergo consistent changes in order for an animal to meet its behavioral needs in a changing environment. These changes may be either in the form of new synapses or an enhancement of their synaptic efficacy, referred to as synaptic plasticity. Thus, synapse formation is not restricted to neurodevelopment; it is a process that remains active throughout life. As the brain ages, either the lack of neuronal activity or cell death render synapses dysfunctional, thus giving rise to neurodegenerative disorders. This review seeks to highlight salient steps that are involved in a neuron's journey, starting with the establishment, maturation, and consolidation of synapses; we particularly focus on identifying key players involved in the synaptogenic program. We hope that this endeavor will not only help the beginners in this field to understand how brain networks are assembled in the first place but also shed light on various neurodevelopmental, neurological, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders that involve synaptic inactivity or dysfunction.},

TDP-43 mislocalization results in cryptic splicing and polyadenylation of pre–messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) encoding stathmin-2 (also known as SCG10), a protein that is required for axonal regeneration. We found that TDP-43 binding to a GU-rich region sterically blocked recognition of the cryptic 3′ splice site in STMN2 pre-mRNA. Targeting dCasRx or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) suppressed cryptic splicing, which restored axonal regeneration and stathmin-2–dependent lysosome trafficking in TDP-43–deficient human motor neurons. In mice that were gene-edited to contain human STMN2 cryptic splice-polyadenylation sequences, ASO injection into cerebral spinal fluid successfully corrected Stmn2 pre-mRNA misprocessing and restored stathmin-2 expression levels independently of TDP-43 binding.},

  abstract = {Consolidated memories can persist from a single day to years, and persistence is improved by retraining or retrieval-mediated plasticity. One retrieval-based way to strengthen memory is the reconsolidation process. Strengthening occurs simply by the presentation of specific cues associated with the original learning. This enhancement function has a fundamental role in the maintenance of memory relevance in animals everyday life. In the present study, we made a step forward in the identification of brain correlates imprinted by the reconsolidation process studying the long-term neural consequences when the strengthened memory is stable again. To reach such a goal, we compared the retention of paired-associate memories that went through retraining process or were labilizated-reconsolidated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied the specific areas activated during retrieval and analyzed the functional connectivity of the whole brain associated with the event-related design. We used Graph Theory tools to analyze the global features of the network. We show that reconsolidated memories imprint a more locally efficient network that is better at exchanging information, compared with memories that were retrained or untreated. For the first time, we report a method to elucidate the neural footprints associated with a relevant function of memory reconsolidation.},

Three-dimensional parametric mesh models were created to examine localized alterations of hippocampal morphology. Although global volumes did not differ between groups, statistical mapping results revealed that in MDD patients, more severe depressive symptoms were associated with greater left hippocampal atrophy, particularly in CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) subfields and the subiculum. However, previous treatment with atypical antipsychotics was associated with a trend towards larger left hippocampal volume. Our findings suggest effects of illness severity on hippocampal size, as well as a possible effect of past history of atypical antipsychotic treatment, which may reflect prolonged neuroprotective effects. This possibility awaits confirmation in longitudinal studies.},

  abstract = {This experiment sought to identify the extent housing conditions can differentially enhance or dampen the effects chronic restraint stress has on exploration and object memory in male and female rats. Subjects were either pair- or singly housed during stress (21 days of 6-h restraint) and maintained under those conditions during poststress behavior testing (7 days). Neurochemical analysis of neural tissue was accomplished by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Interactions between stress and housing conditions were found across both sexes. Stress was associated with less activity in the center of the forced open-field in both sexes. Stress also decreased the latency for males to enter the free open-field to female levels. Object recognition was greatly impaired in double-housed males but unaffected by stress or housing in females. Object location memory was impaired in stressed males if they were singly housed, and females performed as well as control males only if they were stressed. Both sexes generally showed increased in hippocampal (CA3) norepinephrine levels in their respective stress groups. Singly housed subjects had higher CA1 serotonin levels compared to double-housed subjects, whereas in the prefrontal cortex, a general sex difference was found with females having higher levels of serotonin and dopamine metabolites. These results show that stress affects limbic neurochemistry across sex, although only males exhibit stress-dependent decrements in object memory. Housing condition also has a profound effect on neurochemistry and male performance on object recognition. Thus, housing condition is a critical variable for male models of stress that can influence the extent the stress manipulation affects behavior. The differences observed across sex are further discussed in the context of behavioral inhibition. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Marr’s 1971 simple memory theory of archicortex set the stage for over four decades of subsequent research on the medial temporal lobe memory system. Marr’s ideas contributed fundamentally to current computational models of the hippocampus. In particular, this theory led to the widely held view of the hippocampus as a temporary memory store that accurately memorizes events by creating orthogonalized representations (pattern separation), while using its associative pathways to retrieve the original event from a partial cue. Although Marr’s model has garnered considerable empirical support, subsequent research also calls into question some of its key assumptions. Future extensions to the model must address these data. There have also been several game-changing neuroscientific discoveries, such as neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and the fate of remote memories in densely amnesic patients; these findings require us to rethink the notion of the hippocampus as a simple memory system. Even the long-held view that the hippocampus performs a fundamentally different computation than the neocortex may be incorrect. Converging evidence suggests instead that the hippocampus is at the apex of a multi-level cortical hierarchy that encodes progressively more abstract information at each level, and is as involved in predictive perceptual coding as it is in memory.},

  abstract = {The generation of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain has led to numerous theories as to their functional significance. One of the most widely held views is that adult neurogenesis promotes pattern separation, a process by which overlapping patterns of neural activation are mapped to less overlapping representations. While a large body of evidence supports a role for neurogenesis in high interference memory tasks, it does not support the proposed function of neurogenesis in mediating pattern separation. Instead, the adult-generated neurons seem to generate highly overlapping and yet distinct distributed representations for similar events. One way in which these immature, highly plastic, hyperactive neurons may contribute to novel memory formation while avoiding interference is by virtue of their extremely sparse connectivity with incoming perforant path fibers. Another intriguing proposal, awaiting empirical confirmation, is that the young neurons’ recruitment into memory formation is gated by a novelty/mismatch mechanism mediated by CA3 or hilar back-projections. Ongoing research into the intriguing link between neurogenesis, stress-related mood disorders, and age-related neurodegeneration may lead to promising neurogenesis-based treatments for this wide range of clinical disorders.

In humans, ketamine-induced transient, and disorder associated chronic NMDAR hypofunction (i.e. in schizophrenia) has been associated with deficient performance in the domains of memory and higher-order emotional functioning, as well as altered neural activity in the underlying limbic-prefrontal circuits. To model the effects of NMDAR hypofunction on the integration of emotion and cognition the present pharmacological fMRI study applied the NMDAR antagonist ketamine (target plasma level=100 ng/ml) to 21 healthy volunteers in a within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design during encoding of neutral, positive and negative pictures. Our results show that irrespective of emotion, ketamine suppressed parahippocampal and medial prefrontal activity. In contrast, ketamine selectively increased amygdala and orbitofrontal activity during successful encoding of negative stimuli. On the network level ketamine generally increased medial prefrontal-parahippocampal coupling while specifically decreasing amygdala-orbitofrontal interplay during encoding of negative stimuli. On the behavioural level, ketamine produced generally decreased memory performance and abolished the emotional enhancement of memory after a wash-out period of 5 days. The present findings suggest that ketamine produces general as well as valence-specific effects during emotional memory formation. The pattern partly overlaps with alterations previously observed in patients with schizophrenia.},

We show how these data are generally well explained by the theory of input-driven self-organization, with a family of computational models of cortical maps offering a parsimonious account for a wide range of map-related phenomena. We then discuss important challenges to this explanation, with respect to the maps present at birth, maps present under activity blockade, the limits of adult plasticity, and the lack of some maps in rodents. Because there is not at present another credible general theory for cortical map development, we conclude by proposing key experiments to help uncover other mechanisms that might also be operating during map development.},

Female rats are known to have higher basal serum corticosterone (CORT) levels and to manifest a more rapid and stronger CORT response to novel stressors. Sex differences in stress responses to the handling and forced swimming in the WM task might contribute to the sex difference in WM performance. In Experiment 1, naive females were found to be impaired relative to naive males in swimming to a visible platform in a WM pool due to strongly thigmotaxic swimming by females. In Experiment 2, serum CORT, a physiological measure of stress, was highly elevated during and after WM training, with female{$>$}male values and strong inverse correlations between CORT and measures of WM performance in females. Familiarization with the WM pool and test procedures by strategies pretraining prior to spatial training reduced or eliminated the sex differences in the stress response and WM performance. In Experiment 3, adrenalectomy to eliminate the stress response eliminated sex differences in WM performance. Taken together, the results suggest that male and female rats may harbor brain circuitry that is equally capable of accurate spatial navigation and memory in the WM but which may be impaired to different degrees by the differential stress responses triggered by WM testing. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Adaptive behavior is characterized by our ability to create, maintain, and update (or switch) rules by which we categorize and respond to stimuli across changing contexts (cognitive flexibility). Recent research suggests that people can link the control process of task-switching to contextual cues through associative learning, whereby the behavioral cost of switching is reduced for contexts that require frequent switching. One example is the listwide proportion switch (LWPS) effect, denoting smaller switch costs in blocks of trials where switching is more frequent. However, the conditions that govern such learned cognitive flexibility are poorly understood. One major unanswered question is whether this type of learning benefits from memory consolidation effects. To address this question, we manipulated whether task-sets and/or specific task stimuli were more frequently linked with task-switching (vs. repeating), and ran participants over two experimental sessions, separated by a 24-hr delay. We expected that consolidation would facilitate learned cognitive flexibility, resulting in a greater reduction of switch costs with increasing task-switch likelihood on Session 2 compared with Session 1. Across two experiments, we observed robust LWPS effects in both sessions. However, we found little evidence for effects of consolidation on learned cognitive flexibility: The magnitude of the LWPS effect did not change from Session 1 to 2. Altogether our results suggest that people reliably and quickly acquire task-set and stimulus-based switch associations, but this form of control learning-unlike many instances of reward-based learning-does not benefit from long-term memory consolidation. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Volumetric reductions in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are among the most well-documented neural abnormalities in major depressive disorder (MDD). Hippocampal and mPFC structural reductions have been specifically tied to MDD illness progression markers, including greater number of major depressive episodes (MDEs), longer illness duration, and nonremission/treatment resistance. Chronic stress plays a critical role in the development of hippocampal and mPFC deficits, with some studies suggesting that these deficits occur irrespective of MDE occurrence. However, preclinical and human research also points to other stress-mediated neurotoxic processes, including enhanced inflammation and neurotransmitter disturbances, which may require the presence of an MDE and contribute to further brain structural decline as the illness advances. Specifically, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter abnormalities (e.g., serotonin, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid) likely interact to facilitate illness progression in MDD. Congruent with stress sensitization models of MDD, with each consecutive MDE it may take lower levels of stress to trigger these neurotoxic pathways, leading to more pronounced brain volumetric reductions. Given that stress and MDD have overlapping and distinct influences on neurobiological pathways implicated in hippocampal and mPFC structural decline, further work is needed to clarify which precise mechanisms ultimately contribute to MDD development and maintenance.},

  abstract = {For decades, the mammalian hippocampus has been the focus of cellular, anatomical, behavioral, and computational studies aimed at understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying cognition. Long recognized as the brain's seat for learning and memory, a wealth of knowledge has been accumulated on how the hippocampus processes sensory input, builds complex associations between objects, events, and space, and stores this information in the form of memories to be retrieved later in life. However, despite major efforts, our understanding of hippocampal cognitive function remains fragmentary, and models trying to explain it are continually revisited. Here, we review the literature across all above‐mentioned domains and offer a new perspective by bringing attention to the most distinctive, and generally neglected, feature of the mammalian hippocampal formation, namely, the structural separability of the two blades of the dentate gyrus into “supra‐pyramidal” and “infra‐pyramidal”. Next, we discuss recent reports supporting differential effects of adult neurogenesis in the regulation of mature granule cell activity in these two blades. We propose a model for how differences in connectivity and adult neurogenesis in the two blades can potentially provide a substrate for subtly different cognitive functions.},

Here we show, by analysing the chemical space between 1996 and 2022, that its expansion has been dominated by China ever since 2013. Chinese dominance occurs at different levels, from organic to rare-earth chemistry, but is less dramatic in organometallic chemistry. We also found that Chinese dominance is mainly the product of the country’s own efforts, rather than the result of international collaboration. China’s surge mainly comes at the expense of the contribution of the US. Interestingly, the US share of the chemical space is more dependent on international collaboration, which mainly occurs with China. We also observe the emergent role of India. We believe these results provide a contemporary account of the geopolitics of the chemical space, which may constitute the basis for future national and international science policies, as well as research and development agendas.},

Predictors of individual relapse risk after antidepressant discontinuation could help to guide treatment and mitigate the long-term course of depression. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed to identify relapse predictors using the search terms ‘(depress* OR MDD*) AND (relapse* OR recurren*) AND (predict* OR risk) AND (discontinu* OR withdraw* OR maintenance OR maintain or continu*) AND (antidepress* OR medication OR drug)’ for published studies until November 2014. Studies investigating predictors of relapse in patients aged between 18 and 65 years with a main diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), who remitted from a depressive episode while treated with ADM and were followed up for at least 6 months to assess relapse after part of the sample discontinued their ADM, were included in the review. Although relevant information is present in many studies, only 13 studies based on nine separate samples investigated predictors for relapse after ADM discontinuation. There are multiple promising predictors, including markers of true treatment response and the number of prior episodes. However, the existing evidence is weak and there are no established, validated markers of individual relapse risk after antidepressant cessation. There is little evidence to guide discontinuation decisions in an individualized manner beyond overall recurrence risk. Thus, there is a pressing need to investigate neurobiological markers of individual relapse risk, focusing on treatment discontinuation.},

In the last 2 weeks of stress exposure, animals were treated with the antidepressants fluoxetine, imipramine, CP 156,526 or SSR 1494515, alone or combined with methylazoxymethanol, a cytostatic agent used to arrest neurogenesis. We found that antidepressants retain their therapeutic efficacy in reducing both measured indices of depression-like behavior (learned helplessness and anhedonia), even when neurogenesis is blocked.

Moreover, they are involved in regulation of neurotransmitter systems implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression (e.g., dopamine or GABA). Clinical and preclinical studies have suggested that 5-HT3 receptors may be a relevant target in the treatment of affective disorders. 5-HT3 receptor agonists seem to counteract the effects of antidepressants in non-clinical models, whereas 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, present antidepressant-like activities. In addition, several antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, also target 5-HT3 receptors. In this review, we will report major advances in the research of 5-HT3 receptor's roles in neuropsychiatric disorders, with special emphasis on mood and anxiety disorders.},

One structure of particular interest when considering aging and cognitive decline is the hippocampus, a brain region known to play an important role in learning and memory consolidation as well as in affective behaviours and mood regulation, and where both functional and structural plasticity (e.g., neurogenesis) occur well into adulthood. Neurobiological alterations seen in the aging hippocampus including increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, altered intracellular signalling and gene expression, as well as reduced neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, are thought to be associated with age-related cognitive decline. Non-invasive strategies such as caloric restriction, physical exercise, and environmental enrichment have been shown to counteract many of the age-induced alterations in hippocampal signalling, structure, and function. Thus, such approaches may have therapeutic value in counteracting the deleterious effects of aging and protecting the brain against age-associated neurodegenerative processes.},

Excessive ROS generation and exhaustion of antioxidative defences trigger proinflammatory signaling, damaging vital macromolecules and inducing cellular apoptosis. The failure of cells to maintain redox homeostasis and resultant generation of proinflammatory mediators leads to cell necrosis. The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress (OS) because of its higher oxygen consumption, higher lipid content, and weaker antioxidative defence. OS is a main cause of neurodegeneration and its involvement in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unequivocally established. OS and proinflammatory signaling have emerged as mainstays in the pathogenesis of MDD. Targeting these changes with suitable antioxidants could be an effective strategy to treat MDD.},

Little work has been done integrating various risk factors for depression, to determine the combinations of factors with the greatest utility for identifying which individuals are at the greatest risk. Materials and methods: This study demonstrates that data-driven Machine Learning (ML) methods such as Random Effects/Expectation Maximization (RE-EM) trees and Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF) can be applied to reliably identify variables that have the greatest utility for classifying subgroups at greatest risk for depression. 185 young adults completed measures of depression risk, including rumination, worry, negative cognitive styles, cognitive and coping flexibilities and negative life events, along with symptoms of depression. We trained RE-EM trees and MERF algorithms and compared them to traditional Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) predicting depressive symptoms prospectively and concurrently with cross-validation. Results: Our results indicated that the RE-EM tree and MERF methods model complex interactions, identify subgroups of individuals and predict depression severity comparable to LMM. Further, machine learning models determined that brooding, negative life events, negative cognitive styles, and perceived control were the most relevant predictors of future depression levels. Conclusion: Random effects machine learning models have the potential for high clinical utility and can be leveraged for interventions to reduce vulnerability to depression.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a critical role in a wide spectrum of hippocampus-dependent functions. Brain pathologies that involve the hippocampus like epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, are commonly associated with cognitive impairments and mood disorders. These insults can affect neural stem cells and the subsequent neurogenic cascade in the hippocampus, resulting in the induction of aberrant neurogenesis, which is thought to compromise hippocampal network function, thereby hampering hippocampus-dependent behavior. We here summarize recent preclinical literature on hippocampal insult-induced changes in neurogenesis and based on that, we propose that normalizing aberrant neurogenesis post-insult may help to prevent or rescue behavioral deficits which could help develop novel therapeutic strategies.},

Physiological studies in humans and rodents have suggested that there is both structural and functional heterogeneity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. However, the recent discovery of discrete gene expression domains in the mouse hippocampus has provided the opportunity to re-evaluate hippocampal connectivity. To integrate mouse hippocampal gene expression and connectivity, we mapped the distribution of distinct gene expression patterns in mouse hippocampus and subiculum to create the Hippocampus Gene Expression Atlas (HGEA). Notably, previously unknown subiculum gene expression patterns revealed a hidden laminar organization. Guided by the HGEA, we constructed the most detailed hippocampal connectome available using Mouse Connectome Project ( http://www.mouseconnectome.org ) tract tracing data. Our results define the hippocampus' multiscale network organization and elucidate each subnetwork's unique brain-wide connectivity patterns.},

  abstract = {How do antidepressants elicit an antidepressant response? Here, we review accumulating evidence that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a transducer, acting as the link between the antidepressant drug and the neuroplastic changes that result in the improvement of the depressive symptoms. Over the last decade several studies have consistently highlighted BDNF as a key player in antidepressant action. An increase in hippocampal and cortical expression of BDNF mRNA parallels the antidepressant-like response of conventional antidepressants such as SSRIs. Subsequent studies showed that a single bilateral infusion of BDNF into the ventricles or directly into the hippocampus is sufficient to induce a relatively rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effect. Importantly, the antidepressant-like response to conventional antidepressants is attenuated in mice where the BDNF signaling has been disrupted by genetic manipulations. Low dose ketamine, which has been found to induce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients with treatment-resistant depression, is also dependent on increased BDNF signaling. Ketamine transiently increases BDNF translation in hippocampus, leading to enhanced synaptic plasticity and synaptic strength. Ketamine has been shown to increase BDNF translation by blocking NMDA receptor activity at rest, thereby inhibiting calcium influx and subsequently halting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase leading to a desuppression of protein translation, including BDNF translation. The antidepressant-like response of ketamine is abolished in BDNF and TrkB conditional knockout mice, eEF2 kinase knockout mice, in mice carrying the BDNF met/met~allele, and by intra-cortical infusions of BDNF-neutralizing antibodies. In summary, current data suggests that conventional antidepressants and ketamine mediate their antidepressant-like effects by increasing BDNF in forebrain regions, in particular the hippocampus, making BDNF an essential determinant of antidepressant efficacy.},

The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane., 2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec., 3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells., 4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments., 5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (`frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation., 6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) is legal in the US and New Zealand, but illegal in the rest of the world. Little or no research exists on the social welfare implications of DTCA. AIM: To quantify the total costs and benefits associated with both appropriate and inappropriate care due to DTCA, for the case of depression. METHODS: A cost-benefit model was developed using parameter estimates from available survey, epidemiological and experimental data. The model estimates the total benefits and costs (year 2002 values) of new appropriate and inappropriate care stimulated by DTCA for depression. Uncertainty in model parameters is addressed with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: This study provides evidence that 94\% of new antidepressant use due to DTCA is from non-depressed individuals. However, the average health benefit to each new depressed user is 63-fold greater than the cost per treatment, creating a positive overall social welfare effect; a net benefit of {$>$}72 million US dollars. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that DTCA may lead to antidepressant treatment in 15-fold as many non-depressed people as depressed people. However, the costs of treating non-depressed people may be vastly outweighed by the much larger benefit accruing to treated depressed individuals. The cost-benefit ratio can be improved through better targeting of advertisements and higher quality treatment of depression.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants are prescribed for the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, however there is still controversy about whether they should be used in this population. This meta-review aimed to assess the effects of antidepressants for the acute treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders (ADs), autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), enuresis, major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. Efficacy was measured as response to treatment (either as mean overall change in symptoms or as a dichotomous outcome) and tolerability was measured as the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. Suicidality was measured as suicidal ideation, behavior (including suicide attempts) and completed suicide. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched (until 31 October 2019) for existing systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of double-blind randomized controlled trials. The quality of the included reviews was appraised using AMSTAR-2. Our meta-review included nine systematic reviews/meta-analyses (2 on ADHD; 1 on AD; 2 on ASD; 1 on enuresis; 1 on MDD, 1 on OCD and 1 on PTSD). In terms of efficacy this review found that, compared to placebo: fluoxetine was more efficacious in the treatment of MDD, fluvoxamine and paroxetine were better in the treatment of AD; fluoxetine and sertraline were more efficacious in the treatment of OCD; bupropion and desipramine improved clinician and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; clomipramine and tianeptine were superior on some of the core symptoms of ASD; and no antidepressant was more efficacious for PTSD and enuresis. With regard to tolerability: imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine were less well tolerated in MDD; no differences were found for any of the antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety disorders (ADs), ADHD, and PTSD; tianeptine and citalopram, but not clomipramine, were less well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD. For suicidal behavior/ideation, venlafaxine (in MDD) and paroxetine (in AD) were associated with a significantly increased risk; by contrast, sertraline (in AD) was associated with a reduced risk. The majority of included systematic reviews/meta-analyses were rated as being of high or moderate in quality by the AMSTAR-2 critical appraisal tool (one and five, respectively). One included study was of low quality and two were of critically low quality. Compared to placebo, selected antidepressants can be efficacious in the acute treatment of some common psychiatric disorders, although statistically significant differences do not always translate into clinically significant results. Little information was available about tolerability of antidepressants in RCTs of OCD and in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, MDD, and PTSD. There is a paucity of data on suicidal ideation/behavior, but paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidality in the treatment of AD and venlafaxine for MDD. Findings from this review must be considered in light of potential limitations, such as the lack of comparative information about many antidepressants, the short-term outcomes and the quality of the available evidence.},

Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved graphs from recent publications, completed by tutorial material online (appendices, web pages and film clips). The popular matrix form (multiple graphs in one frame) is discussed as a special case. Differences between publication (including the proofing stage) and presentation are outlined.

Whole frozen hippocampi from untreated subjects with MDD (N=5), antidepressant-treated MDD (MDDT, N=7), and controls (C, N=7) were fixed, sectioned, and immunostained for NPCs and dividing cell markers (nestin and Ki-67, respectively), NeuN and GFAP, in single and double labeling. NPC and dividing cell numbers in the DG were estimated by stereology. Clinical data were obtained by psychological autopsy, and by toxicological and neuropathological examination performed on all subjects. NPCs decreased with age (p=0.034). Females had more NPCs than males (p=0.023). Correcting for age and sex, MDDT receiving SSRIs had more NPCs than untreated MDD (p⩽0.001) and controls (p⩽0.001), NPCs were not different in SSRI- and TCA-treated MDDT (p=0.169). Dividing cell number, unaffected by age or sex, was greater in MDDT receiving TCAs than in untreated MDD (p⩽0.001), SSRI-treated MDD (p=0.001), and controls (p⩽0.001). The increase of NPCs and dividing cells in MDDT was localized to the rostral DG. MDDT had a larger DG volume compared with untreated MDD or controls (p=0.009). Antidepressants increase NPC number in the anterior human DG. Whether this finding is critical or necessary for the antidepressants effect remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Smaller hippocampal volume is reported in major depressive disorder (MDD). We hypothesize that it may be related to fewer granule neurons (GN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), a defect possibly reversible with antidepressants. We studied age-, sex-, and postmortem interval-matched groups: no major psychopathology (controls); unmedicated-MDD; and MDD treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (MDD*SSRI) or tricyclics (MDD*TCA). Frozen right hippocampi were fixed, sectioned (50\,μm), immunostained with neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN), and counterstained with hematoxylin. GN and glial number, and DG and granule cell layer (GCL) volumes were stereologically estimated. Fewer GNs in the anterior DG were present in unmedicated-MDDs compared with controls (p=0.013). Younger age of MDD onset correlated with fewer GNs (p=0.021). Unmedicated-MDDs had fewer mid-DG GNs than MDD*SSRIs (p=0.028) and controls (p=0.032). Anterior GCL glial number did not differ between groups. Anterior/mid GCL volume was smaller in unmedicated-MDDs vs controls (p=0.008) and larger in MDD*SSRIs vs unmedicated-MDDs (p{$<$}0.001), MDD*TCAs (p{$<$}0.001), and controls (p{$<$}0.001). Anterior GCL volume and GN number (r=0.594, p=0.001), and mid DG volume and GN number (r=0.398, p=0.044) were correlated. Anterior DG capillary density correlated with GN number (p=0.027), and with GCL (p=0.024) and DG (r=0.400, p=0.047) volumes. Posterior DG volume and GN number did not differ between groups. Fewer GNs in unmedicated-MDD without fewer neuronal progenitor cells, as previously reported, suggests a cell maturation or survival defect, perhaps related to MDD duration. This may contribute to a smaller hippocampus and is potentially reversed by SSRIs. Postmortem studies are correlative and animal studies are needed to test implied causal relationships.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress is a risk factor for the development of many psychopathological conditions in humans, including major depression and anxiety disorders. There is a high degree of comorbidity of depression and anxiety. Moreover, cognitive impairments associated with frontal lobe dysfunction, including deficits in cognitive set-shifting and behavioral flexibility, are increasingly recognized as major components of depression, anxiety disorders, and other stress-related psychiatric illnesses. To begin to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cognitive and emotional consequences of chronic stress, it is necessary to employ an animal model that exhibits similar effects. In the present study, a rat model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) consistently induced a cognitive impairment in extradimensional set shifting capability in an attentional set shifting test, suggesting an alteration in function of the medial prefrontal cortex. CUS also increased anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze. Further, chronic treatment both with the selective norepinephrine reuptake blocker, desipramine (7.5\,mg/kg/day), and the selective serotonin reuptake blocker, escitalopram (10\,mg/kg/day), beginning 1 week before CUS treatment and continuing through the behavioral testing period, prevented the CUS-induced deficit in extradimensional set-shifting. Chronic desipramine treatment also prevented the CUS-induced increase in anxiety-like behavioral reactivity on the plus-maze, but escitalopram was less effective on this measure. Thus, CUS induced both cognitive and emotional disturbances that are similar to components of major depression and anxiety disorders. These effects were prevented by chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs, consistent also with clinical evidence that relapse of depressive episodes can be prevented by antidepressant drug treatment.},

There are different types of plasticity, which vary with age, brain region, and species. These observations stress the importance of defining plasticity along temporal and spatial dimensions. We review recent studies focused on brain plasticity across the lifespan and in different species. One main theme to emerge from this work is that plasticity declines with age but that we have yet to map these different forms of plasticity across species. As part of this effort, we discuss our recent progress aimed to identify corresponding ages across species, and how this information can be used to map temporal variation in plasticity from model systems to humans.},

  abstract = {Neuronal plasticity can vary remarkably in its form and degree across animal species. Adult neurogenesis, namely the capacity to produce new neurons from neural stem cells through adulthood, appears widespread in non-mammalian vertebrates, whereas it is reduced in mammals. A growing body of comparative studies also report variation in the occurrence and activity of neural stem cell niches between mammals, with a general trend of reduction from small-brained to large-brained species. Conversely, recent studies have shown that large-brained mammals host large amounts of neurons expressing typical markers of neurogenesis in the absence of cell division. In layer II of the cerebral cortex, populations of prenatally generated, non-dividing neurons continue to express molecules indicative of immaturity throughout life (cortical immature neurons; cINs). After remaining in a dormant state for a very long time, these cINs retain the potential of differentiating into mature neurons that integrate within the preexisting neural circuits. They are restricted to the paleocortex in small-brained rodents, while extending into the widely expanded neocortex of highly gyrencephalic, large-brained species. The current hypothesis is that these populations of non-newly generated “immature” neurons might represent a reservoir of developmentally plastic cells for mammalian species that are characterized by reduced stem cell-driven adult neurogenesis. This indicates that there may be a trade-off between various forms of plasticity that coexist during brain evolution. This balance may be necessary to maintain a “reservoir of plasticity” in brain regions that have distinct roles in species-specific socioecological adaptations, such as the neocortex and olfactory structures.},

In this Perspective article, we compare leading theories of DG function. We note that these theories all critically rely on the generation of distinct patterns of activity in the region to signal differences between experiences and to~reduce interference between memories. However, these theories are divided by the roles they attribute to the DG during learning and recall and by the contributions they ascribe to specific inputs or cell types within the DG. These differences influence the information that the DG is thought to impart to downstream structures. We work towards a holistic view of the role of DG in learning and memory by first developing three critical questions to foster a dialogue between the leading theories. We then evaluate the extent to which previous studies address our questions, highlight remaining areas of conflict, and suggest future experiments to bridge these theories.},

While studies incorporating CUMS prior to an intervention often require long-lasting stress effects that persist after exposure is ceased, the longevity of these effects is rarely studied. Additionally, it is unclear whether behavioural assessments can be performed before and after interventions without repeated testing effects. In rats, we investigated CUMS effects on components of depressive-like behaviour both acutely after stress cessation and after a recovery period, as well as effects of repeated testing. We observed acute disruptions of the circadian locomotor rhythm and a reduced sucrose preference immediately after CUMS exposure. While circadian locomotor rhythm effects persisted up until four weeks after stress cessation, independently of repeated testing, sucrose preference effects did not. Interestingly, CUMS animals tested once after a recovery period of four weeks showed reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the open field and elevated plus maze compared to their control group and repeatedly-tested CUMS animals. These findings suggest that distinct CUMS-induced components of depressive-like behaviour are affected differentially by recovery time and repeated testing; these aspects should be considered carefully in future study designs.},

Reinstatement of antidepressants seems less effective in some patients, but an overview is lacking.

The phenomenon was observed in 16.5\% of patients with a depressive disorder, OCD, and social phobia and occurred in all common classes of antidepressants. The range of response failure was broad, varying between 3.8 and 42.9\% across studies. No risk factors for failure to respond were investigated. The overall study quality was limited. \textbf{\mkbibemph{Conclusion:}} Research investigating response failure is scarce and the study quality limited. Response failure occurred in a substantial minority of patients. Contributors to the relevance of this phenomenon are the prevalence of the investigated disorders, the number of patients being treated with antidepressants, and the occurrence of response failure for all common classes of antidepressants. This systematic review highlights the need for studies systematically investigating this phenomenon and associated risk factors.},

  abstract = {Psychedelic agents have a long history of use by humans for their capacity to induce profound modifications in perception, emotion and cognitive processes. Despite increasing knowledge of the neural mechanisms involved in the acute effects of these drugs, the impact of sustained psychedelic use on the human brain remains largely unknown. Molecular pharmacology studies have shown that psychedelic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)2A agonists stimulate neurotrophic and transcription factors associated with synaptic plasticity. These data suggest that psychedelics could potentially induce structural changes in brain tissue. Here we looked for differences in cortical thickness (CT) in regular users of psychedelics. We obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the brains of 22 regular users of ayahuasca (a preparation whose active principle is the psychedelic 5HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) and 22 controls matched for age, sex, years of education, verbal IQ and fluid IQ. Ayahuasca users showed significant CT differences in midline structures of the brain, with thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the default mode network. CT values in the PCC were inversely correlated with the intensity and duration of prior use of ayahuasca and with scores on self-transcendence, a personality trait measuring religiousness, transpersonal feelings and spirituality. Although direct causation cannot be established, these data suggest that regular use of psychedelic drugs could potentially lead to structural changes in brain areas supporting attentional processes, self-referential thought, and internal mentation. These changes could underlie the previously reported personality changes in long-term users and highlight the involvement of the PCC in the effects of psychedelics.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a chronic, recurring and potentially life-threatening illness that affects up to 10\% of the population worldwide. Pharmacological and genetic studies highlight the serotonergic system as being a key player in the disorder. However, despite drugs designed to boost serotonin transmission represent the first line of therapy for depression, the role of this system still remains elusive. Here, I propose a new theoretical framework, the undirected susceptibility to change model, potentially accounting for the experimental and clinical results concerning the role of this neurotransmitter in depression. Since the capacity of the individual to change its physiology and behavior according to the environment is dependent on neural plasticity which, in turn, is controlled by serotonin, I assume that changes in the levels of serotonin affect the sensitivity to the environment. Consequently, the undirected susceptibility to change model predicts that an increase of serotonin levels, for instance induced through selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration, does not affect mood per se, but--acting as a catalyzer--enhances neural plasticity and, thus, the effects of the environment on mood. However, since the environment can be either supportive or adverse, its effects can be beneficial or detrimental. Therefore enhancing the serotonin system can increase the likelihood both of developing the psychopathology and recovering from it. This model, on the one hand, suggests an explanation for the limited SSRI efficacy described in clinical studies and allows apparently contradictory data to be reconciled; on the other, it describes neural plasticity as a double edged sword that, according to the quality of the environment, may have either positive or negative consequences.},

Therefore, a paradigm shift able to overcome such limitation is warranted. Behavior and the associated mental states are the interface between the central nervous system and the living environment. Since, in any system, the interface is a key regulator of system organization, behavior is proposed here as a unique and privileged level of control and orchestration of brain structure and activity. This view has relevant scientific and clinical implications. First, the study of behavior represents a singular starting point for the investigation of neural activity in an integrated and comprehensive fashion. Second, behavioral changes, accomplished through psychotherapy or environmental interventions, are expected to have the highest impact to specifically reorganize the complexity of the human mind and thus achieve a solid and long-lasting improvement in mental health.},

  abstract = {The GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-. d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor shows age-related declines in expression across the frontal cortex and hippocampus. This decline is strongly correlated to age-related memory declines. This study was designed to determine if increasing GluN2B subunit expression in the frontal lobe or hippocampus would improve memory in aged mice. Mice were injected bilaterally with either the GluN2B vector, containing cDNA specific for the GluN2B subunit and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP); a control vector or vehicle. Spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, and associative memory were assessed using the Morris water maze. Aged mice, with increased GluN2B subunit expression, exhibited improved long-term spatial memory, comparable to young mice. However, memory was rescued on different days in the Morris water maze; early for hippocampal GluN2B subunit enrichment and later for the frontal lobe. A higher concentration of the GluN2B antagonist, Ro 25-6981, was required to impair long-term spatial memory in aged mice with enhanced GluN2B expression, as compared to aged controls, suggesting there was an increase in the number of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. In addition, hippocampal slices from aged mice with increased GluN2B subunit expression exhibited enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP). Treatment with Ro 25-6981 showed that a greater proportion of the NMDA receptor-mediated EPSP was due to the GluN2B subunit in these animals, as compared to aged controls. These results suggest that increasing the production of the GluN2B subunit in aged animals enhances memory and synaptic transmission. Therapies that enhance GluN2B subunit expression within the aged brain may be useful for ameliorating age-related memory declines. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Masturbation occurs throughout the animal kingdom. At first glance, however, the fitness benefits of this self-directed behaviour are unclear. Regardless, several drivers have been proposed. Non-functional hypotheses posit that masturbation is either a pathology, or a byproduct of high underlying sexual arousal, whereas functional hypotheses argue an adaptive benefit. The Postcopulatory Selection Hypothesis states that masturbation aids the chances of fertilization, while the Pathogen Avoidance Hypothesis states that masturbation helps reduce host infection by flushing pathogens from the genital tract. Here, we present comprehensive new data documenting masturbation across the primate order and use these, in conjunction with phylogenetic comparative methods, to reconstruct the evolutionary pathways and correlates of masturbation. We find that masturbation is an ancient trait within the primate order, becoming a more common aspect of the haplorrhine behavioural repertoire after the split from tarsiers. Our analyses provide support for both the Postcopulatory Selection and Pathogen Avoidance Hypotheses in male primates, suggesting that masturbation may be an adaptive trait, functioning at a macroevolutionary scale.},

Here, we propose the initial metabolic trigger of hominid brain expansion was the consumption of externally fermented foods. We define “external fermentation” as occurring outside the body, as opposed to the internal fermentation in the gut. External fermentation could increase the bioavailability of macro- and micronutrients while reducing digestive energy expenditure and is supported by the relative reduction of the human colon. We discuss the explanatory power of our hypothesis and survey external fermentation practices across human cultures to demonstrate its viability across a range of environments and food sources.

  abstract = {Background Reliable measurement of affective state in animals is a significant goal of animal welfare. Such measurements would also improve the validity of pre-clinical mental health research which relies on animal models. However, at present, affective states in animals are inaccessible to direct measurement. In humans, changes in cognitive processing can give reliable indications of emotional state. Therefore, similar techniques are increasingly being used to gain proxy measures of affective states in animals. In particular, the ‘cognitive bias’ assay has gained popularity in recent years. Major disadvantages of this technique include length of time taken for animals to acquire the task (typically several weeks), negative experiences associated with task training, and issues of motivation. New method Here we present a shortened cognitive bias protocol using only positive reinforcers which must actively be responded to. Results The protocol took an average of 4~days to complete, and produced similar results to previous, longer methods (minimum 30~days). Specifically, rats housed in standard laboratory conditions demonstrated negative cognitive biases when presented with ambiguous stimuli, and took longer to make a decision when faced with an ambiguous stimulus. Comparison with existing methods Compared to previous methods, this protocol is significantly shorter (average 4~days vs. minimum 30~days), utilises only positive reinforcers to avoid inducing negative affective states, and requires active responses to all cues, avoiding potential confounds of motivational state. Conclusions We have successfully developed a shortened cognitive bias protocol, suitable for use with laboratory rats.},

Data can help support decision making for a more productive and safer work environment, but only if the data can be, is and should be trusted. Especially with the advance of more data collection of varying quality, checking and judging the data is an increasingly complex task. Within such tasks, cognitive biases are likely to occur, causing analysists to overestimate the quality of the data and safety experts to base their decisions on data of insufficient quality. Cognitive biases describe generic error tendencies of persons, that arise because people tend to automatically rely on their fast information processing and decision making, rather than their slow, more effortful system. This article describes five biases that were identified in the verification of a safety indicator related to train driving. Suggestions are also given on how to formalize the verification process. If decision makers want correct conclusions, safety experts need good quality data. To make sure insufficient quality data is not used for decision making, a solid verification process needs to be put in place that matches the strengths and limits of human cognition.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is involved in segregating memories, an ability that utilizes the neural process of pattern separation and allows for cognitive flexibility. We evaluated a proposed role for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive flexibility using variants of the active place avoidance task and two independent methods of ablating adult-born neurons, focal X-irradiation of the hippocampus, and genetic ablation of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive neural progenitor cells, in mice. We found that ablation of adult neurogenesis did not impair the ability to learn the initial location of a shock zone. However, when conflict was introduced by switching the location of the shock zone to the opposite side of the room, irradiated and transgenic mice entered the new shock zone location significantly more than their respective controls. This impairment was associated with increased upregulation of the immediate early gene Arc in the dorsal dentate gyrus, suggesting a role for adult neurogenesis in modulating network excitability and/or synaptic plasticity. Additional experiments revealed that irradiated mice were also impaired in learning to avoid a rotating shock zone when it was added to an initially learned stationary shock zone, but were unimpaired in learning the identical simultaneous task variant if it was their initial experience with place avoidance. Impaired avoidance could not be attributed to a deficit in extinction or an inability to learn a new shock zone location in a different environment. Together these results demonstrate that adult neurogenesis contributes to cognitive flexibility when it requires changing a learned response to a stimulus-evoked memory. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The lack of response to treatment by many patients prompts the need to develop new therapeutic alternatives and to better understand the etiology of the disorder. Pre-clinical models with translational merits are rudimentary for this task. Here we present a protocol for the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) method in mice. In this protocol, adolescent mice are chronically exposed to interchanging unpredictable mild stressors. Resembling the pathogenesis of depression in humans, stress exposure during the sensitive period of mice adolescence instigates a depressive-like phenotype evident in adulthood. UCMS can be used for screenings of antidepressants on the variety of depressive-like behaviors and neuromolecular indices. Among the more prominent tests to assess depressive-like behavior in rodents is the sucrose preference test (SPT), which reflects anhedonia (core symptom of depression). The SPT will also be presented in this protocol. The ability of UCMS to induce anhedonia, instigate long-term behavioral deficits and enable reversal of these deficits via chronic (but not acute) treatment with antidepressants strengthens the protocol's validity compared to other animal protocols for inducing depressive-like behaviors.},

  abstract = {The ability to update and modify previously learned behavioral responses in a changing environment is essential for successful utilization of promising opportunities and for coping with adverse events. Valid models of cognitive flexibility that contribute to behavioral flexibility include set-shifting and reversal learning. One immediate effect of acute stress is the selective impairment of performance on higher-order cognitive control tasks mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not the hippocampus. Previous studies show that the mPFC is required for set-shifting but not for reversal learning, therefore the aim of the present experiment is to assess whether exposure to acute stress (15. min of mild tail-pinch stress) given immediately before testing on either a set-shifting or reversal learning tasks would impair performance selectively on the set-shifting task. An automated operant chamber-based task, confirmed that exposure to acute stress significantly disrupts set-shifting but has no effect on reversal learning. Rats exposed to an acute stressor require significantly more trials to reach criterion and make significantly more perseverative errors. Thus, these data reveal that an immediate effect of acute stress is to impair mPFC-dependent cognition selectively by disrupting the ability to inhibit the use of a previously relevant cognitive strategy. © 2013 .},

  abstract = {Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities, while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes) is detrimental to memory trace formation.},

  abstract = {Fluoxetine (FL) is being used in neuropharmacology as a tool for studying various functional roles of serotoninergic neurons. Its kinetics was studied in rats, a species widely used in neurochemical studies, after IV (2.5–10 mg/kg) and oral (5–20 mg/kg) administration. When injected IV the drug followed apparent first-order kinetics up the 10 mg/kg dose. Its volume of distribution was large and total body clearance was relatively high compared to liver blood flow. The mean elimination half-lives (t1/2) of FL and its active metabolite norfluoxetine (NFL) were about 5 and 15 h, respectively. The mean blood:plasma concentration ratios of FL and NFL approached unity and plasma protein binding was 85–90\% for both compounds. After oral doses the kinetics of FL were complex. At the lowest dose tested (5 mg/kg) the drug was efficiently extracted by the liver (extraction ratio about 60\%), resulting in bioavailability of only about 38\%. Plasma areas under the curve (AUC) of the metabolite were approximately the same as after IV injection of the same dose; consequently the metabolite-to-parent drug ratio after oral administration (about 5) was approximately twice that after IV injection of FL (about 2.5). At higher doses, however, the oral bioavailability (e.g.Cmax and AUC) appeared greater than expected, possibly because of transient saturation of FL first-pass metabolism in the case of the 10 mg/kg dose and concomitant saturation of elimination kinetics at the higher dose (20 mg/kg). The apparent eliminationt1/2 of FL markedly increased and the metabolite-to-parent drug ratio declined with the higher dose, this also being consistent with saturable elimination. Brain concentrations reflected the plasma kinetics of FL and NFL and the metabolite-to-parent drug ratio varied with dose and time of administration and was modified at the highest dose tested. FL and its metabolite NFL distributed almost evenly in discrete brain areas and subcellular distribution was similar for both compounds. Neurochemical studies of FL should consider the formation of the active metabolite NFL and extrapolation of data across animal species requires consideration of dose dependence in the rat.},

  abstract = {During hippocampal-dependent memory formation, sensory signals from the neocortex converge in the dentate gyrus. It is generally believed that the dentate gyrus decorrelates inputs in order to minimize interference between codes for similar experiences, often referred to as pattern separation. The proportion of dentate neurons that are activated by experience is therefore likely to impact how memories are stored and separated. Emerging evidence from mouse models suggests that adult-born neurons can both increase and decrease activity levels in the dentate gyrus. However, the conditions that determine the direction of this modulation, and whether it occurs in other species, remains unclear. Furthermore, since the dentate gyrus is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells that are born throughout life, newborn neurons may not modulate all cells equally. We aimed to investigate whether adult neurogenesis in rats regulates activity in dentate gyrus neurons that are born at the peak of early postnatal development. Adult neurogenesis was increased by subjecting rats to an alternating running and memantine treatment schedule, and it was decreased with a transgenic GFAP-TK rat model. Activity was measured by Fos expression in BrdU+ cells after rats explored a novel environment. Running+memantine treatment increased adult neurogenesis by only 17\%, but completely blocked experience-dependent Fos expression. In contrast, GFAP-TK rats had a 68\% reduction in adult neurogenesis but normal experience-dependent Fos expression. The inconsistent relationship between neurogenesis and Fos expression suggests that neurogenesis does not regulate DG activity during exploration of a novel environment. Nonetheless, running and memantine may benefit disorders where there is elevated activity in the dentate gyrus, such as anxiety and age-related memory impairments.},

  abstract = {The decrease of microglia in the hippocampus is a novel mechanism for depression onset. Reversal of this decrease can ameliorate stress-induced depression-like behaviors in rodents. However, the property of this therapeutic strategy remains unclear. We addressed this issue by designing a series of behavioral experiments. Results showed that a single lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection at the dose of 75 and 100 μg/kg, but not at 30 or 50 μg/kg, produced obvious antidepressant effects in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mice at 5 h after the drug administration. In the time-dependent experiment, a single LPS injection (100 μg/kg) ameliorated the CUS-induced depression-like behaviors in mice at 5 and 8 h, but not at 3 h, after the drug administration. The antidepressant effect of a single LPS injection persisted at least 10 days and disappeared at 14 days after the drug administration. 14 days after the first injection, a second LPS injection (100 μg/kg) still produced antidepressant effects in chronically-stressed mice who re-displayed depression-like behaviors at 5 h after the drug administration. The antidepressant effect of LPS appears to be dependent on microglia, as at 5 h after LPS administration (100 μg/kg), the CUS-induced decrease in microglial numbers and Iba-1 mRNA levels in the hippocampus was reversed markedly, and inhibition of microglia by minocycline (40 mg/kg) or PLX33297 (290 mg/kg) prevented the antidepressant effect of LPS in CUS mice. These results indicate that a single LPS injection displays rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in chronically stressed mice likely through stimulating hippocampal microglia.},

Inhibition of adult neurogenesis produces some behavioral impairments that suggest a role for new neurons in learning and memory; however, other behavioral changes appear inconsistent with this function. A review of studies investigating the function of the hippocampus going back several decades reveals many ideas that seem to converge on a critical role for the hippocampus in stress response and emotion. These potential hippocampal functions provide new avenues for investigating the behavioral functions of adult neurogenesis. And, conversely, studies in animals lacking adult neurogenesis, which are likely to have more limited and more specific impairments than are seen with lesions, may provide valuable new insights into the function of the hippocampus. A complete understanding of the function of the hippocampus must explain its role in emotion and the relationship between its emotional and memory functions.},

Specifically, we suggest that new neurons in the dentate gyrus enhance behavioral adaptability to changes in the environment, biasing behavior in novel situations based on previous experience with stress. Conversely, atrophy-like changes in the hippocampus and decreased adult neurogenesis following chronic stress may serve to limit stress responses and stabilize behavior during chronic stress.},

In this opinion piece, we draw attention to a long-recognised component of the psychedelic treatment model, namely ‘set’ and ‘setting’ – subsumed here under the umbrella term ‘context’. We highlight: (a) the pharmacological mechanisms of classic psychedelics (5-HT2A receptor agonism and associated plasticity) that we believe render their effects exceptionally sensitive to context, (b) a study design for testing assumptions regarding positive interactions between psychedelics and context, and (c) new findings from our group regarding contextual determinants of the quality of a psychedelic experience and how acute experience predicts subsequent long-term mental health outcomes. We hope that this article can: (a) inform on good practice in psychedelic research, (b) provide a roadmap for optimising treatment models, and (c) help tackle unhelpful stigma still surrounding these compounds, while developing an evidence base for long-held assumptions about the critical importance of context in relation to psychedelic use that can help minimise harms and maximise potential benefits.},

  abstract = {Adult neurogenesis consists in the generation of newborn neurons from neural stem cells taking place in the adult brain. In mammals, this process is limited to very few areas of the brain, and one of these neurogenic niches is the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Adult newborn neurons are generated from quiescent neural progenitors (QNPs), which differentiate through different steps into mature granule cells (GCs), to be finally integrated into the existing hippocampal circuitry.                                                        In animal models, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is relevant for pattern discrimination, cognitive flexibility, emotional processing and resilience to stressful situations. Imaging techniques allow to visualize newborn neurons within the hippocampus through all their stages of development and differentiation. In humans, the evidence of AHN is more challenging, and, based on recent findings, it persists through adulthood, even if it declines with age. Whether this process has an important role in human brain function and how it integrates into the existing hippocampal circuitry is still a matter of exciting debate. Importantly, AHN deficiency has been proposed to be relevant in many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia.                                                        This review aims to investigate how AHN is altered in different psychiatric conditions and how pharmacological treatments can rescue this process. In fact, many psychoactive drugs, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics (AAPs), can boost AHN with different results. In addition, some non-pharmacological approaches are discussed, as well.},

  abstract = {Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the today’s most common psychological disorders, affecting mainly women, and is directly related to stressful daily events and high glucocorticoid levels. Studies on the neurobiology of depression require experimental models, and the most widely used ones are based on the exposure of animals to chronic stressors for more than 5 weeks. Thus, the present work aimed to standardize a nonclinical model of depressive-like behavior induction, to be carried out in less time (2 weeks) and using easily accessible stressors. Method: Swiss female mice (Mus musculus) were used in the experimental model of unpredictable subchronic stress (USS) and received 2–4 stressors/day for 14 days; on the 15th day, they were subjected to the behavioral tests of tail suspension test (TST), splash test (SPT), and open field (OF); after the tests, they were sacrificed and their hippocampus removed for neurochemical analysis. Results: In the behavioral tests such as TST, SPT, and OF (p {$<$}.05), the mice submitted to stressors showed depressive and anxious-type behavior. Imipramine reversed these depressive-like behaviors, indicating predictive validity to the protocol. In neurochemical analyses, USS induced an increase in corticosterone and stimulation of the serotonin degradation pathway by 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), in addition to reduced dopamine levels (p {$<$}.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that USS is a simple, reproducible, and effective way to induce depressive-like behavior in animals and that it can face and construct validity, in the same way of other animal models for studying depression, in a shorter time and with accessible stressors},

  abstract = {The involvement of glutamatergic receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type in long-term behavioral habituation (LTH) to a novel environment was investigated. To this aim, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first exposed to a Làt-maze. Horizontal (corner-crossings) and vertical activity (rearings) were measured per 1-min block. Immediately after a 10-min test trial in the maze, rats were systemically injected with either 6 or 20 mg/kg of the allosteric NMDA receptor blocker ketamine-HCl (KET) or vehicle. Retention was tested one week later. LTH was expressed as the decline in horizontal and vertical activity from test trial 1 to test trial 2. The results showed a facilitation of the two components of LTH at 6 mg/kg and a disruption at 20 mg/kg. This biphasic effect pertained to vertical activity only. For both activity components, the facilitation of LTH at 6 mg/kg pertained to the first part, whereas the inhibition at 20 mg/kg pertained to the second part of the testing period. Since horizontal and vertical activity are thought to have a prevailing cognitive (spatial) and non-cognitive (emotional) meaning, subanesthetic doses of KET differentially affect the long-lasting retention of these behavioral responses to novelty. Thus, NMDA receptors seem to be involved in the coupling of spatial and emotional components of information. © 1990.},

CHIM mice were made by embryo aggregation and the chimerism degree of their brain was inferred from coat black/white distribution. Discriminant analysis of EPM and OF factorial scores of C57BL/6, BALB/c and CHIM mice showed that CHIM mice with an exceeding (≥80\%) C57BL/6 or BALB/c coat component had behaviours similar to those of the predominant strain, whereas CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism differed from both inbred strains. Additional MANOVA analysis showed that the anxiety behaviour of CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism was similar to that of B6CBF1 mice as for factors not describing the inbred strains, including a motor activity mostly limited to protected areas, with attempts to approach the anxiogenic areas while processing/storing the external information. We conclude that the balanced presence of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c genetic backgrounds, either when carried by the same cell or by different cells, gives rise to a novel stress coping strategy described by factors different from those of the inbred strains.},

Discriminant analysis of EPM and OF factorial scores of C57BL/6, BALB/c and CHIM mice showed that CHIM mice with an exceeding (≥80\%) C57BL/6 or BALB/c coat component had behaviours similar to those of the predominant strain, whereas CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism differed from both inbred strains. Additional MANOVA analysis showed that the anxiety behaviour of CHIM mice with intermediate chimerism was similar to that of B6CBF1 mice as for factors not describing the inbred strains, including a motor activity mostly limited to protected areas, with attempts to approach the anxiogenic areas while processing/storing the external information. We conclude that the balanced presence of both C57BL/6 and BALB/c genetic backgrounds, either when carried by the same cell or by different cells, gives rise to a novel stress coping strategy described by factors different from those of the inbred strains.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In addition to its role as a neuronal energy substrate and signaling molecule involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, recent evidence shows that lactate produces antidepressant effects in animal models. However, the mechanisms underpinning lactate’s antidepressant actions remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that lactate reverses the effects of corticosterone on depressive-like behavior, as well as on the inhibition of both the survival and proliferation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, the inhibition of adult hippocampal neurogenesis prevents the antidepressant-like effects of lactate. Pyruvate, the oxidized form of lactate, did not mimic the effects of lactate on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Finally, our data suggest that conversion of lactate to pyruvate with the concomitant production of NADH is necessary for the neurogenic and antidepressant effects of lactate.},

Here, we examined the role of the ventral hippocampus (vHipp)-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway in ketamine's antidepressant response. Inactivation of the vHipp with lidocaine prevented the sustained, but not acute, antidepressant-like effect of ketamine as measured by the forced swim test (FST). Moreover, optogenetic as well as pharmacogenetic specific activation of the vHipp-mPFC pathway using DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) mimicked the antidepressant-like response to ketamine; importantly, this was pathway specific, in that activation of a vHipp to nucleus accumbens circuit did not do this. Furthermore, optogenetic inactivation of the vHipp/mPFC pathway at the time of FST completely reversed ketamine's antidepressant response. In addition, we found that a transient increase in TrkB receptor phosphorylation in the vHipp contributes to ketamine's sustained antidepressant response. These data demonstrate that activity in the vHipp-mPFC pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine.},

We propose that like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability towards novel experiences.},

  abstract = {Deformation of brain tissue in response to mechanical loading of the head is the root-cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Even below ultimate failure limits, deformation activates pathophysiological cascades resulting in delayed cell death. Injury response of soft tissues, such as the chest and spinal cord, is dependent on the product of deformation and velocity, a parameter termed the viscous criterion. We set out to test if hippocampal cell death could be predicted by a similar combination of strain and strain rate and if the viscous criterion was valid for hippocampus. Quantitative prediction of the brain's biological response to mechanical stimuli is difficult to achieve in animal models of TBI, so we utilized an in vitro model of TBI based on hippocampal slice cultures. We quantified the temporal development of cell death after precisely controlled deformations for 30 combinations of strain (0.05–0.50) and strain rate (0.1–50s−1) relevant to TBI. Loading conditions for a subset of cultures were verified by analysis of high-speed video. Cell death was found to be significantly dependent on time-post injury, on strain magnitude, and to a lesser extent, on anatomical region by a repeated-measures, three-way ANOVA. The responses of the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus were not statistically different in contrast to some in vivo TBI studies. Surprisingly, cell death was not dependent on strain rate leading us to conclude that the viscous criterion is not a valid predictor for hippocampal tissue injury. Given the large data set and extensive combinations of biomechanical parameters, predictive mathematical functions relating independent variables (strain, region, and time post-injury) to the resultant cell death were defined. These functions can be used as tolerance criteria to equip finite element models of TBI with the added capability to predict biological consequences.},

We investigated whether a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) phosphorylation is involved with these stress effects. Using an acute inescapable stress protocol with rats, we found opposite effects on AMPA receptor phosphorylation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus (DH) compared to the amygdala and ventral hippocampus (VH). After stress, the phosphorylation of Ser831-GluA1 was markedly decreased in the mPFC and DH, whereas the phosphorylation of Ser845-GluA1 was increased in the amygdala and VH. Stress also modulated the GluA2 subunit with a decrease in the phosphorylation of both Tyr876-GluA2 and Ser880- GluA2 residues in the amygdala, and an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser880-GluA2 in the mPFC. These results demonstrate that exposure to acute stress causes subunit-specific and region-specific changes in glutamatergic transmission, which likely lead to the reduced synaptic efficacy in the mPFC and DH and augmented activity in the amygdala and VH. In addition, these findings suggest that modifications of glutamate receptor phosphorylation could mediate the disruptive effects of stress on cognition. They also provide a means to reconcile the contrasting effects that stress has on synaptic plasticity in these regions. Taken together, the results provide support for a brain region-oriented approach to therapeutics. © 2010 Caudal et al.},

The article explores the controversy surrounding the claim that Prozac patients experience suicidal and violent thoughts as a result of the drug; the author goes on to discuss the issue of the psychiatrist's potential liability when something goes wrong and when the drug has been prescribed to a patient who is well. Following is a summary of current civil and criminal litigation surrounding the Prozac controversy.  The author concludes that in most cases, the legal and ethical implications of prescribing Prozac to the "normal" patient should prohibit psychiatrists from doing so; however, the reality is that the prescription of Prozac to patients who are not clinically depressed is already widespread. Thus, the author concludes that the psychiatric community must encourage public debate and education.},

Because prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction characterizes many stress-related disorders, we here analyzed the impact of chronic stress in rats on the integrity of the hippocampal-PFC pathway, monitored by behavioral and electrophysiological function and morphological assessment. We show that chronic stress impairs synaptic plasticity by reducing LTP induction in the hippocampal-PFC connection; in addition, it induces selective atrophy within the PFC and severely disrupts working memory and behavioral flexibility, two functions that depend on PFC integrity. We also demonstrate that short periods of stress exposure induce spatial reference memory deficits before affecting PFC-dependent tasks, thus suggesting that the impairment of synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus-to-PFC connection is of relevance to the stress-induced PFC dysfunction. These findings evidence a fundamental role of the PFC in maladaptive responses to stress and identify this area as a target for intervention in stress-related disorders.},

At the presynaptic level, numerous stressors increase nerve firing and extracellular 5-HT at the level of serotonergic cell bodies or nerve terminals. Different studies have reported stressor- and region-specific changes in extracellular 5-HT, a view challenged by electrophysiological and neurochemical evidence for a nonspecific response of serotonergic neurones to stressors when activity/arousal is taken into account. In addition, early studies indicate that stress-induced elevation in 5-HT synthesis, a key counter-regulatory process allowing serotonergic homeostasis, is mediated by specific neuroendocrine mechanisms. In addition to the multiplicity of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors and their specific regulation by corticoids, specificity to stressors is also underscored when considering one receptor type such as the 5-HT1A receptor. Stress studies should consider the past experience and the genetic status of the individual as key modulators of the serotonergic responses to stress.},

It includes the indusium griseum, longitudinal striae, gyrus fasciolaris, hippocampus proper (cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, and subiculum) and part of the uncus. The hippocampus has the archipallial cortex and is formed by the infoldings of the dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis and subiculum. The dentate gyrus is a narrow crenated strip of grey matter. The dentate gyrus consists of three layers, from the outside in: the molecular layer, granular layer, and polymorphic layer. The granular neurons receive input from the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal cortex) via the perforant pathway. The granular neurons send mossy fibers to the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells present in the cornu ammonis. The axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells form a sheet of white fibers known as the alveus which continues as fimbria and fornix. The fornix projects into the septal area. From the septal area few fibers synapse into the cingulate gyrus which returns to the hippocampus. The neuronal intrinsic circuit, known as the Papez circuit of the hippocampus, plays a crucial role in the memory processing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Pattern separation is a mnemonic process that has been extensively studied over the years. It entails the ability ‐of primarily hippocampal circuits‐ to distinguish between highly similar inputs, via generating different neuronal activity (output) patterns. The dentate gyrus (DG) in particular has long been hypothesized to implement pattern separation by detecting and storing similar inputs as distinct representations. The ways in which these distinct representations can be generated have been explored in a number of theoretical and computational modeling studies. Here, we review two categories of pattern separation models: those that address the phenomenon in an abstract mathematical fashion and those that delve into the underlying biological mechanisms by taking into account the anatomy and/or physiology of hippocampal circuits. We summarize the strategies, findings and limitations of these modeling approaches in the light of new experimental findings and propose a unifying framework whereby different network, cellular and sub‐cellular mechanisms converge to a common goal: controlling sparsity, the key determinant of pattern separation in the DG.},

In pediatric age, most studies have focused on patients with autism. However, evidence of the role played by the MGBA in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood, is still scanty and heterogeneous. This review aims to provide the current evidence on the functioning of the MGBA in pediatric patients with ADHD and the specific role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in this interaction, as well as the potential of the GM as a therapeutic target for ADHD. We will explore: (1) the diverse communication pathways between the GM and the CNS; (2) changes in the GM composition in children and adolescents with ADHD and association with ADHD pathophysiology; (3) influence of the GM on the ω-3 PUFA imbalance characteristically found in ADHD; (4) interaction between the GM and circadian rhythm regulation, as sleep disorders are frequently comorbid with ADHD; (5) finally, we will evaluate the most recent studies on the use of probiotics in pediatric patients with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) has been long recognized to modulate the stress response, and dysfunction of 5-HT has been implicated in numerous stress disorders. Accordingly, the 5-HT system has been targeted for the treatment of stress disorders. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, and the recent identification of a second, neuron-specific TPH isoform (TPH2) opened up a new area of research. With a decade of extensive investigation, it is now recognized that: (1) TPH2 exhibits a highly flexible gene expression that is modulated by an increasing number of internal and external environmental factors including the biological clock, stressors, endogenous hormones, and antidepressant therapies; and (2) genetically determined TPH2 activity is linked to a growing body of stress-related neuronal correlates and behavioral traits. These findings reveal an active role of TPH2 in the stress response and provide new insights into the long recognized but not yet fully understood 5-HT–stress interaction. As a major modulator of 5-HT neurotransmission and the stress response, TPH2 is of both pathophysiological and pharmacological significance, and is emerging as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of stress disorders. Given that numerous antidepressant therapies influence TPH2 gene expression, TPH2 is already inadvertently targeted for the treatment of stress disorders. With increased understanding of the regulation of TPH2 activity we can now purposely utilize TPH2 as a target to develop new or optimize current therapies, which are expected to greatly improve the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of stress disorders.},

However, the probability of committing false statistical inferences would considerably increase when more than one hypothesis is simultaneously tested (namely the multiple comparisons), which therefore requires proper adjustment. Although the adjustment for multiple comparisons is proposed to be mandatory in some journals, it still remains difficult to select a proper method suitable for the various experimental properties and study purposes, especially for researchers without good background in statistics.

Previous investigations of reports of clinical research showed that graphs are underused and, when used, often depict summary statistics instead of the data distribution. This descriptive study aims to evaluate the quantity and quality of graphs in the current medical literature across a broad range of better journals. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of 10 randomly selected original research articles per journal from the 2012 issues of 20 highly cited journals. We identified which figures were data graphs and limited analysis to a maximum of 5 randomly selected data graphs per article. We then described the graph type, data density, completeness, visual clarity, special features, and dimensionality of each graph in the sample. RESULTS: We analyzed 342 data graphs published in 20 journals. Our sample had a geometric mean data density index across all graphs of 1.18 data elements/cm2. More than half (54\%) of the data graphs were simple univariate displays such as line or bar graphs. When analyzed by journal, excellence in one domain (completeness, visual clarity, or special features) was not strongly predictive of excellence in the other domains. CONCLUSION: Despite that graphs can efficiently and effectively convey complex study findings, we found their infrequent use and low data density to be the norm. The majority of graphs were univariate ones that failed to display the overall distribution of data.},

  abstract = {Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a reliability metric that gauges similarity when, for example, entities are measured under similar, or even the same, well‐controlled conditions, which in MRI applications include runs/sessions, twins, parent/child, scanners, sites, and so on. The popular definitions and interpretations of ICC are usually framed statistically under the conventional ANOVA platform. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of ICC analysis in its prior usage in neuroimaging, and we show that the standard ANOVA framework is often limited, rigid, and inflexible in modeling capabilities. These intrinsic limitations motivate several improvements. Specifically, we start with the conventional ICC model under the ANOVA platform, and extend it along two dimensions: first, fixing the failure in ICC estimation when negative values occur under degenerative circumstance, and second, incorporating precision information of effect estimates into the ICC model. These endeavors lead to four modeling strategies: linear mixed‐effects (LME), regularized mixed‐effects (RME), multilevel mixed‐effects (MME), and regularized multilevel mixed‐effects (RMME). Compared to ANOVA, each of these four models directly provides estimates for fixed effects and their statistical significances, in addition to the ICC estimate. These new modeling approaches can also accommodate missing data and fixed effects for confounding variables. More importantly, we show that the MME and RMME approaches offer more accurate characterization and decomposition among the variance components, leading to more robust ICC computation. Based on these theoretical considerations and model performance comparisons with a real experimental dataset, we offer the following general‐purpose recommendations. First, ICC estimation through MME or RMME is preferable when precision information (i.e., weights that more accurately allocate the variances in the data) is available for the effect estimate; when precision information is unavailable, ICC estimation through LME or the RME is the preferred option. Second, even though the absolute agreement version, ICC(2,1), is presently more popular in the field, the consistency version, ICC(3,1), is a practical and informative choice for whole‐brain ICC analysis that achieves a well‐balanced compromise when all potential fixed effects are accounted for. Third, approaches for clear, meaningful, and useful result reporting in ICC analysis are discussed. All models, ICC formulations, and related statistical testing methods have been implemented in an open source program 3dICC, which is publicly available as part of the AFNI suite. Even though our work here focuses on the whole‐brain level, the modeling strategy and recommendations can be equivalently applied to other situations such as voxel, region, and network levels.},

Results Evaluation of demographic characteristics, symptomatology, other clinical data, dexamethasone suppression test, neuroimage exams, response to treatment, evolution and family morbidity indicated that SAD occupies an intermediate position between SCH and MD. Literature review also failed to indicate a clear cut distinction between SAD and SCH or MD. Discussion Present analysis indicated that SAD cannot be interpreted as atypical forms of SCH or MD. SAD also does not appear to represent a SCH and MD comorbidity or yet an independent mental disorder. It is argued that SAD might constitute a heterogeneous group composed by both SCH and MD patients or a middle point of a continuum between SCH and MD.},

In order to better understand SSRI action, we explored the hypothesis that SSRIs do not affect mood per se but amplify the influence of the living conditions on mood. To this aim, we exploited the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) data set, selected a subpopulation of 591 patients with an overlapping clinical history and analyzed treatment outcome according to dosage -20 or 40\,mg per day of citalopram. We found that sociodemographic characteristics affected treatment response in the same direction in the two dose groups, but these effects reached statistical significance only in the 40\,mg per day dose group. In the latter, higher improvement rate was associated with having a working employment status (P=0.0219), longer education (P=0.0053), high income (P=0.01) or a private insurance (P=0.0031), and the higher remission rate was associated with having a working employment status (P=0.0326) or longer education (P=0.0484). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of the sociodemographic characteristics on mood, measured as the percent of patients showing a positive outcome when exposed to favorable living conditions, was much greater-up to 37-fold-in the 40 compared to the 20\,mg per day dose group. Overall, our results indicate that citalopram amplifies the influence of the living conditions on mood in a dose-dependent manner. These findings provide a potential explanation for the variable efficacy of SSRIs and might lead to the development of personalized strategies aimed at enhancing their efficacy.},

  abstract = {This tutorial is the result of a couple of years of trying different software packages and reference manager setups. After some trial and error, I’ve settled on a system that is smooth, efficient, and free.  The key is to use Zotero in conjunction with a cloud-based storage service. With this setup you will be able to: 1) Download, rename, and organize academic papers, news articles, web sites, and other reference material with one click; 2) Have virtually unlimited storage for your PDFs with automatic back up; 3) Extract highlighted text and annotations from PDFs and associate them with references 4) Search and insert references within a Word document and automatically insert a reference list in the required formatting style of virtually any journal; 5) Create multiple libraries that you can share with collaborators and/or the public. Aside from the practical advantages of switching to Zotero, there are also ethical arguments for doing so, which I have outlined in the following blog post: https://tinyurl.com/tee6rv5},

  abstract = {Human evolution has been marked by a striking increase in total brain volume relative to body size. While a prominent and characteristic feature of this volumetric shift has been the disproportionate expansion of association cortex across our evolutionary lineage, descent with modification is apparent throughout all neural systems in both human and nonhuman primates. However, despite evidence for the ubiquitous and complex influence of evolutionary forces on brain biology, within the psychological sciences the vast majority of the literature on human brain evolution is entirely corticocentric. This selective focus has contributed to a flawed theoretical framework in which the evolution of association cortex is viewed as an isolated process, removed from the rest of the brain. Here, we review our current understanding of how evolutionary pressures have acted across anatomically and functionally coupled networks, highlighting the diverse set of rules and principles that govern human brain development. In doing so we challenge the systemic mischaracterization of human cognition and behavior as a competition that pits phylogenetically recent cortical territories against evolutionarily ancient subcortical and cerebellar systems. Rather, we propose a comprehensive view of human brain evolution with critical importance for the use of animal models, theory development, and network-focused approaches in the study of behavior across health and disease.

  abstract = {Amyloid β (Aβ) plays a major role in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded Aβ causes oxidative stress and inflammatory  damage leading to apoptotic cell death. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM)  has been widely used in treating neurodegenerative diseases by reducing oxidative  stress and neuroinflammation. We examined the neuroprotective effect of  formulated CHM Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang, made of Paeonia lactiflora and  Glycyrrhiza uralensis at 1:1 ratio) in AD cell and mouse models. In Aβ-GFP  SH-SY5Y cells, SG-Tang reduced Aβ aggregation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)  production, as well as improved neurite outgrowth. When the Aβ-GFP-expressing  cells were stimulated with conditioned medium from interferon (IFN)-γ-activated  HMC3 microglia, SG-Tang suppressed expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase  (iNOS), NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1) and 3 (NLRP3), tumor  necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, attenuated caspase-1  activity and ROS production, and promoted neurite outgrowth. In  streptozocin-induced hyperglycemic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mice,  SG-Tang also reduced expressions of NLRP1, NLRP3, Aβ and Tau in hippocampus and  cortex, as well as improved working and spatial memories in Y maze and Morris  water maze. Collectively, our results demonstrate the potential of SG-Tang in  treating AD by moderating neuroinflammation.},

  abstract = {The water maze is one of the most frequently used tools in behavioral neuroscience. Many variations of the water maze task have been used; however, established water maze protocols have several disadvantages. Notably, these protocols demand considerable time to perform reference and probe tests separately. Here, we suggest a modified protocol, which is rapidly performed, is sensitive to cognitive deficits, and can assay reference as well as strategy-switching ability. The platform is relocated randomly within the target quadrant with each training trial. Because the rodents must spend more time searching within the target quadrant, every trial effectively becomes a probe trial. The rodents are then run in the switching strategy test, where the platform is randomly placed along the wall of the pool. The best new strategy would thus be to search along the walls of the pool systematically. The percent distance traveled and time spent near the wall is evaluated across trials, as is the distance traveled and time spent in the previously correct quadrant. In this way one can assess whether the rodent is continuing to search in the older platform location (i.e., displaying a strategy-switching problem) or whether it has successfully adopted a new search strategy.},

  abstract = {Ketamine, a multimodal anesthetic drug, has become increasingly popular in the treatment of pain following traumatic injury as well as treatment-resistant major depressive disorders. However, the psychological impact of this dissociative medication on the development of stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains controversial. To address these concerns, preclinical studies have investigated the effects of ketamine administration on fear memory and stress-related behaviors in laboratory animals. Despite a well-documented line of research examining the effects of ketamine on fear memory, there is a lack of literature reviews on this important topic. Therefore, this review article summarizes the current preclinical literature on ketamine and fear memory with a particular emphasis on the route, dose, and timing of ketamine administration in rodent fear conditioning studies. Additionally, this review describes the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine may impact fear memory and stress-related behaviors. Overall, findings from previous studies are inconsistent in that fear memory may be increased, decreased, or unaltered following ketamine administration in rodents. These conflicting results can be explained by factors such as the route, dose, and timing of ketamine administration; the interaction between ketamine and stress; and individual variability in the rodent response to ketamine. This review also recommends that future preclinical studies utilize a clinically relevant route of administration and account for biological sex differences to improve translation between preclinical and clinical investigations.},

  abstract = {Memories of events that occur often are sensitive to interference from memories of similar events. Proactive interference plays an important and often unexamined role in memory testing for spatially and temporally unique events ("episodes"). Ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonist) treatment in humans and other mammals induces a constellation of cognitive deficits, including impairments in working and episodic memory. We examined the effects of the ketamine (2.5-100 mg/kg) on the acquisition, retrieval, and retention of memory in a delayed-match-to-place radial water maze task that can be used to assess proactive interference. Ketamine (2.5-25 mg/kg, i.p.) given 20 min before the sample trial, impaired encoding. The first errors made during the test trial were predominantly to arms located spatially adjacent to the goal arm, suggesting an established albeit weakened representation. Ketamine (25-100 mg/kg) given immediately after the sample trial had no effect on retention. Ketamine given before the test trial impaired retrieval. First errors under the influence of ketamine were predominantly to the goal location of the previous session. Thus, ketamine treatment promoted proactive interference. These memory deficits were not state dependent, because ketamine treatment at both encoding and retrieval only increased the number of errors during the test session. These data demonstrate the competing influence of distinct memory representations during the performance of a memory task in the rat. Furthermore, they demonstrate the subtle disruptive effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine on both encoding and retrieval. Specifically, ketamine treatment disrupted retrieval by promoting proactive interference from previous episodic representations. Copyright © 2008 Society for Neuroscience.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is one of the most common mental disorders in children and adolescents. However, whether to use pharmacological interventions in this population and which drug should be preferred are still matters of controversy. Consequently, we aimed to compare and rank antidepressants and placebo for major depressive disorder in young people. METHODS: We did a network meta-analysis to identify both direct and indirect evidence from relevant trials. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LiLACS, regulatory agencies' websites, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind randomised controlled trials up to May 31, 2015, for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. We included trials of amitriptyline, citalopram, clomipramine, desipramine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, imipramine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of less than ten patients were excluded. We extracted the relevant information from the published reports with a predefined data extraction sheet, and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and tolerability (discontinuations due to adverse events). We did pair-wise meta-analyses using the random-effects model and then did a random-effects network meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate using the GRADE framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015016023. FINDINGS: We deemed 34 trials eligible, including 5260 participants and 14 antidepressant treatments. The quality of evidence was rated as very low in most comparisons. For efficacy, only fluoxetine was statistically significantly more effective than placebo (standardised mean difference -0·51, 95\% credible interval [CrI] -0·99 to -0·03). In terms of tolerability, fluoxetine was also better than duloxetine (odds ratio [OR] 0·31, 95\% CrI 0·13 to 0·95) and imipramine (0·23, 0·04 to 0·78). Patients given imipramine, venlafaxine, and duloxetine had more discontinuations due to adverse events than did those given placebo (5·49, 1·96 to 20·86; 3·19, 1·01 to 18·70; and 2·80, 1·20 to 9·42, respectively). In terms of heterogeneity, the global I(2) values were 33·21\% for efficacy and 0\% for tolerability. INTERPRETATION: When considering the risk-benefit profile of antidepressants in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder, these drugs do not seem to offer a clear advantage for children and adolescents. Fluoxetine is probably the best option to consider when a pharmacological treatment is indicated. FUNDING: National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program).},

However, radial glial cells (RGCs) have not been well characterized during human development and aging. We have previously described progenitor and neuronal layer establishment in the hippocampal pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus from embryonic life until mid-gestation. Here, we describe RGC subtypes in the hippocampus from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to mid-gestation and characterize their evolution and the dynamics of neurogenesis from mid-gestation to adulthood in normal and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. In the pyramidal ventricular zone (VZ), RGC density declined with neurogenesis from mid-gestation until the perinatal period. In the dentate area, morphologic and antigenic differences among RGCs were observed from early ages of development to adulthood. Density and proliferative capacity of dentate RGCs as well as neurogenesis were strongly reduced during childhood until 5 years, few DCX+ cells are seen in adults. The dentate gyrus of both control and AD individuals showed Nestin+ and/or GFAPδ+ cells displaying different morphologies. In conclusion, pools of morphologically, antigenically, and topographically diverse neural progenitor cells are present in the human hippocampus from early developmental stages until adulthood, including in AD patients, while their neurogenic potential seems negligible in the adult.},

This article traces the successful development of an animal model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia, which eventually identified the structures in the medial temporal lobe important for memory. Attention is given to two prominent behavioral paradigms (delayed nonmatching to sample and tests of spontaneous novelty preference).},

  abstract = {We begin by describing an historical scientific debate in which the fundamental idea that species are related by evolutionary descent was challenged. The challenge was based on supposed neuroanatomical differences between humans and other primates with respect to a structure known then as the hippocampus minor. The debate took place in the early 1860s, just after the publication of Darwin’s famous book. We then recount the difficult road that was traveled to develop an animal model of human memory impairment, a matter that also turned on questions about similarities and differences between humans and other primates. We then describe how the insight that there are multiple memory systems helped to secure the animal model and how the animal model was ultimately used to identify the neuroanatomy of long-term declarative memory (sometimes termed explicit memory). Finally, we describe a challenge to the animal model and to cross-species comparisons by considering the case of the concurrent discrimination task, drawing on findings from humans and monkeys. We suggest that analysis of such cases, based on the understanding that there are multiple memory systems with different properties, has served to emphasize the similarities in memory function across mammalian species.},

  abstract = {Mice are the most widely used model species for drug discovery and scientific research. Consequently, it is important to refine laboratory procedures and practices to ensure high standards of welfare and scientific data quality. Recent studies have identified that the standard practice of handling laboratory mice by their tails increases behaviours indicative of anxiety, which can be overcome by handling mice using a tunnel. However, despite clear negative effects on mice's behaviour, tunnel handling has yet to be widely implemented. In this study, we provide the first evidence that tail handling also reduces mice's responses to reward. Anhedonia is a core symptom of clinical depression, and is measured in rodents by assessing how they consume a sucrose solution: depressed mice consume less sucrose and the size of their licking bouts when drinking (their 'lick cluster sizes') also tend to be smaller. We found that tail handled mice showed more anhedonic responses in both measures compared to tunnel handled mice, indicative of a decreased responsiveness to reward and potentially a more depressive-like state. Our findings have significant implications for the welfare of laboratory mice as well as the design and interpretation of scientific studies, particularly those investigating or involving reward.},

  abstract = {GPS navigation is commonplace in everyday life. While it has the capacity to make our lives easier, it is often used to automate functions that were once exclusively performed by our brain. Staying mentally active is key to healthy brain aging. Therefore, is GPS navigation causing more harm than good? Here we demonstrate that traditional turn-by-turn navigation promotes passive spatial navigation and ultimately, poor spatial learning of the surrounding environment. We propose an alternative form of GPS navigation based on sensory augmentation, that has the potential to fundamentally alter the way we navigate with GPS. By implementing a 3D spatial audio system similar to an auditory compass, users are directed towards their destination without explicit directions. Rather than being led passively through verbal directions, users are encouraged to take an active role in their own spatial navigation, leading to more accurate cognitive maps of space. Technology will always play a significant role in everyday life; however, it is important that we actively engage with the world around us. By simply rethinking the way we interact with GPS navigation, we can engage users in their own spatial navigation, leading to a better spatial understanding of the explored environment.},

Genomic studies further implicate N-methyl-ᴅ-aspartate receptor-mediated processes in schizophrenia pathology, together with more broadly-defined synaptic plasticity and associative learning processes. Strong pathophysiological links have been demonstrated between fear learning and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. To further investigate the impact of ketamine on associative fear learning, we studied the effects of pre- and post-training ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory in rats. Administration of 25 mg/kg ketamine prior to fear conditioning did not affect consolidation when potentially confounding effects of state dependency were controlled for. Pre-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) impaired the extinction of the conditioned fear response, which was mirrored with the use of a lower dose (8 mg/kg). Post-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) had no effect on the consolidation or extinction of conditioned fear. These observations implicate processes relating to the extinction of contextual fear memory in the manifestation of ketamine-induced phenotypes, and are consistent with existing hypotheses surrounding abnormal associative learning in schizophrenia.},

The underlying cellular correlates of the smaller volume are not clearly known. Postmortem tissues from 17 pairs of depressed and control subjects were obtained at autopsy, and informant-based retrospective psychiatric assessment was performed. Formalin-fixed left temporal lobes were sectioned (40 μm), stained for Nissl substance, and every 60th section selected throughout the entire hippocampus. Total volume of the hippocampal formation was calculated, and total numbers of pyramidal neurons (in hippocampal fields CA1, CA2/3, hilus), dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, and glial cells were estimated stereologically. While hippocampal volume in all MDD subjects was not significantly smaller versus control subjects, in recurrent/chronic MDD, total volume decreased with duration of depressive illness (r=−0.696, p{$<$}0.026). There was no significant difference between MDD and controls in total number or density of pyramidal neurons/granule cells or glial cells in CA1, CA2/3, hilus, or DG. However, CA1 pyramidal neuron density increased with duration of illness in recurrent/chronic MDD (r=0.840, p{$<$}0.002). Granule cell (r=0.971, p{$<$}0.002) and glial cell numbers (r=0.980, p{$<$}0.001) increased with age in those taking antidepressant medication (n=6). Increasing DG granule cell and glial cell numbers with age in antidepressant-treated subjects may reflect proliferative effects of antidepressant medications. Decreasing total volume and increasing CA1 pyramidal neuron density with duration of illness in recurrent/chronic MDD lends support to the neuropil hypothesis of MDD.},

The acute toxicity framework has begun to be investigated, while studies showing genotoxic potential are very limited or not available. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the genotoxicity by treating TK6 cells with 2C-H, 2C-I, 2C-B, 25B-NBOMe, and the popular 3,4-Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). On the basis of cytotoxicity and cytostasis results, we selected the concentrations (6.25-35 µM) to be used in genotoxicity analysis. We used the micronucleus (MN) as indicator of genetic damage and analyzed the MNi frequency fold increase by an automated flow cytometric protocol. All substances, except MDMA, resulted genotoxic; therefore, we evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction as a possible mechanism at the basis of the demonstrated genotoxicity. The obtained results showed a statistically significant increase in ROS levels for all genotoxic phenethylamines confirming this hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of genotoxicity evaluation for a complete assessment of the risk associated also with NPS exposure. Indeed, the subjects who do not have hazardous behaviors or require hospitalization by using active but still "safe" doses could run into genotoxicity and in the well-known long-term effects associated.},

This contextual linking ensures enhanced access to those memories that are most relevant to the context at hand, including specific associations that were previously learned in that context. This principle, referred to as encoding specificity, predicts that context-specific neural states should bias retrieval of particular associations over others, potentially allowing for the disambiguation of retrieval cues that may have multiple associations or meanings. Using a context-odor paired associate learning paradigm in mice, here, we show that chemogenetic manipulation of dentate gyrus ensembles corresponding to specific contexts reinstates context-specific neural states in downstream CA1 and biases retrieval toward context-specific associations.},

Results show that the PSS had adequate reliability and was a better predictor of the outcome in question (depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance) than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independent predictive construct. Additional data indicated adequate reliability and validity of a 4-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews.

The recent advent of recording techniques such as multielectrode arrays and two-photon imaging has made it easier to measure correlations, opening the door to detailed exploration of their properties and contributions to cortical processing. Studies to date, however, have reported discrepant findings, providing a confusing picture. Here, we briefly review these studies and conduct simulations to explore the influence of several experimental and physiological factors on correlation measurements. Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions, and internal states can all dramatically affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates. Given these complicating factors, we offer guidelines for interpreting correlation data and a discussion of how best to evaluate the impact of correlations on cortical processing.},

The goal is to have a system that takes as input an image and returns a count of the objects inside and justification for the prediction in the form of object localization. We repose a problem, originally posed by Lempitsky and Zisserman, to instead predict a count map which contains redundant counts based on the receptive field of a smaller regression network. The regression network predicts a count of the objects that exist inside this frame. By processing the image in a fully convolutional way each pixel is going to be accounted for some number of times, the number of windows which include it, which is the size of each window, (i.e., 32x32 = 1024). To recover the true count we take the average over the redundant predictions. Our contribution is redundant counting instead of predicting a density map in order to average over errors. We also propose a novel deep neural network architecture adapted from the Inception family of networks called the Count-ception network. Together our approach results in a 20\% relative improvement (2.9 to 2.3 MAE) over the state of the art method by Xie, Noble, and Zisserman in 2016.},

  abstract = {Background: Abrupt cessation of therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is associated with a discontinuation syndrome, typified by numerous disabling symptoms, including anxiety. Surprisingly, little is known of the behavioural effect of SSRI discontinuation in animals. Aim: Here, the effect of SSRI discontinuation on anxiety-like behaviour was systematically investigated in mice. Methods: Experiments were based on a three-arm experimental design comprising saline, continued SSRI and discontinued SSRI. Mice were assessed 2\,days after SSRI discontinuation over a 5-day period using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and other anxiety tests. Results: An exploratory experiment found cessation of paroxetine (12\,days) was associated with decreased open-arm exploration and reduced total distance travelled, in male but not female mice. Follow-up studies confirmed a discontinuation effect on the EPM in male mice after paroxetine (12\,days) and also citalopram (12\,days). Mice receiving continued paroxetine (but not citalopram) also showed decreased open-arm exploration but this was dissociable from the effects of discontinuation. The discontinuation response to paroxetine did not strengthen after 28\,days of treatment but was absent after 7\,days of treatment. A discontinuation response was not discernible in other anxiety and fear-learning tests applied 3–5\,days after treatment cessation. Finally, discontinuation effects on the EPM were typically associated with decreased locomotion on the test. However, separate locomotor testing implicated anxiety-provoked behavioural inhibition rather than a general reduction in motor activity. Conclusion: Overall, this study provides evidence for a short-lasting behavioural discontinuation response to cessation of SSRI treatment in mice.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus, a limbic structure important in learning and memory, is particularly sensitive to chronic stress and to glucocorticoids. While glucocorticoids are essential for an effective stress response, their oversecretion was originally hypothesized to contribute to agerelated hippocampal degeneration. However, conflicting findings were reported on whether prolonged exposure to elevated glucocorticoids endangered the hippocampus and whether the primate hippocampus even responded to glucocorticoids as the rodent hippocampus did. This review discusses the seemingly inconsistent findings about the effects of elevated and prolonged glucocorticoids on hippocampal health and proposes that a chronic stress history, which includes repeated elevation of glucocorticoids, may make the hippocampus vulnerable to potential injury. Studies are described to show that chronic stress or prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids can compromise the hippocampus by producing dendritic retraction, a reversible form of plasticity that includes dendritic restructuring without irreversible cell death. Conditions that produce dendritic retraction are hypothesized to make the hippocampus vulnerable to neurotoxic or metabolic challenges. Of particular interest is the finding that the hippocampus can recover from dendritic retraction without any noticeable cell loss. When conditions surrounding dendritic retraction are present, the potential for harm is increased because dendritic retraction may persist for weeks, months or even years, thereby broadening the window of time during which the hippocampus is vulnerable to harm, called the Glucocorticoid Vulnerability Hypothesis. The relevance of these findings is discussed with regard to conditions exhibiting parallels in hippocampal plasticity, including Cushing’s disease, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).},

  abstract = {Spatial navigation is a universal behavior that varies depending on goals, experience and available sensory stimuli. Spatial navigational tasks are routinely used to study learning, memory and goal-directed behavior, in both animals and humans. One popular paradigm for testing spatial memory is the Morris water maze, where subjects learn the location of a hidden platform that offers escape from a pool of water. Researchers typically express learning as a function of the latency to escape, though this reveals little about the underlying navigational strategies. Recently, a number of studies have begun to classify water maze search strategies in order to clarify the precise spatial and mnemonic functions of different brain regions, and to identify which aspects of spatial memory are disrupted in disease models. However, despite their usefulness, strategy analyses have not been widely adopted due to the lack of software to automate analyses. To address this need we developed Pathfinder, an open source application for analyzing spatial navigation behaviors. In a representative dataset, we show that Pathfinder effectively characterizes the development of highly-specific spatial search strategies as male and female mice learn a standard spatial water maze. Pathfinder can read data files from commercially- and freely-available software packages, is optimized for classifying search strategies in water maze paradigms, and can also be used to analyze 2D navigation by other species, and in other tasks, as long as timestamped xy coordinates are available. Pathfinder is simple to use, can automatically determine pool and platform geometry, generates heat maps, analyzes navigation with respect to multiple goal locations, and can be updated to accommodate future developments in spatial behavioral analyses. Given these features, Pathfinder may be a useful tool for studying how navigational strategies are regulated by the environment, depend on specific neural circuits, and are altered by pathology.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the quantity and quality of graphs in the Journal of American Medicine (JAMA), contrasting articles published in 1999 with those published in 2000 after the addition of a dedicated tables and figures editor. We also sought to compare the quality of graphs in JAMA with the quality of graphs in Annals of Emergency Medicine. METHODS: Two reviewers independently assessed all graphs in original research articles from 12 randomly chosen issues of JAMA, 6 each from 1999 and 2000, using a standardized abstraction form. We noted graph type, clarity, and completeness and identified internal discrepancies. We examined the graphs and articles to observe discrepancies with text, to observe efficiency of graph presentation, and to determine whether the graph portrayed unaggregated data. Results were compared with results from a previously published study of graphs from 18 consecutive issues of Annals of Emergency Medicine beginning in January 1998. RESULTS: The 12 JAMA issues contained 56 research articles, with 64 graphs in the 37 articles that had graphs (28 in 27 1999 articles, 36 in 29 2000 articles). Simple bar or point charts (63\%) predominated. We rarely encountered internal errors (8\%), contradictions with text (3\%), numeric distortion (6\%), lack of visual clarity (5\%), nonstandard graphing conventions (11\%), or extraneous decoration (0\%). Graphs generally defined all symbols (98\%), but 31\% were not self-explanatory; that is, despite knowing the study's design and reading the figure's legend, we could not unambiguously interpret the graph. Fourteen percent contained redundancies. Graphs infrequently portrayed by-subject data (9\%) or advanced features (15\%) such as pairing, symbolic dimensionality, or small multiples. Forty-eight percent (21/44) of graphs did not illustrate the underlying distribution, 48\% (26/54) did not depict important covariates, and 67\% (14/21) did not portray pairing inherent in the data. There were no differences between 1999 and 2000 graphs, although we noted more graphs in the 2000 issues. Graph quality was similar in Annals of Emergency Medicine and JAMA, but graphs were more common in the original research articles in JAMA. Although univariate displays predominated in both publications, there were more bivariate displays in Annals of Emergency Medicine but fewer advanced graphic features. CONCLUSION: The graphs in JAMA were similar to those in Annals of Emergency Medicine and, although generally clear and without errors, often failed to depict detailed data. Authors and editors could improve data presentations by incorporating graphic formats that depict stratified, detailed data.},

  abstract = {Learning to navigate a complex environment is not a difficult task for a mammal. For example, finding the correct way to exit a maze following a sequence of cues, does not need a long training session. Just a single or a few runs through a new environment is, in most cases, sufficient to learn an exit path starting from anywhere in the maze. This ability is in striking contrast with the well-known difficulty that any deep learning algorithm has in learning a trajectory through a sequence of objects. Being able to learn an arbitrarily long sequence of objects to reach a specific place could take, in general, prohibitively long training sessions. This is a clear indication that current artificial intelligence methods are essentially unable to capture the way in which a real brain implements a cognitive function. In previous work, we have proposed a proof-of-principle model demonstrating how, using hippocampal circuitry, it is possible to learn an arbitrary sequence of known objects in a single trial. We called this model SLT (Single Learning Trial). In the current work, we extend this model, which we will call e-STL, to introduce the capability of navigating a classic four-arms maze to learn, in a single trial, the correct path to reach an exit ignoring dead ends. We show the conditions under which the eSLT network, including cells coding for places, head-direction, and objects, can robustly and efficiently implement a fundamental cognitive function. The results shed light on the possible circuit organization and operation of the hippocampus and may represent the building block of a new generation of artificial intelligence algorithms for spatial navigation.},

  abstract = {A large portion of basic biomedical research studies are conducted using genetically defined, inbred mouse strains. The C57BL/6 mouse strain is the most widely used genetic background in current rodent research. The rationale for using inbred strains is that all individuals are genetically identical with minimal phenotypic variation, allowing for more statistically powerful analyses. F1 hybrids between two inbred strains are also genetically identical to one another but are heterozygous at every locus at which the parental strains differ rather than homozygous. Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that this heterozygosity in F1 hybrids allow for potentially greater resilience in response to the inevitable stresses of laboratory environments. The purpose of this study was to characterize the differences in commonly used tests of physical performance (forelimb grip strength and rotarod) and anxiety-like behavior between the F1 hybrids created from BALB/c females mated to C57BL/6 males (called CB6F1 mice) and one of its parental strains, C57BL/6. We used a natural cross-fostering breeding scheme to minimize maternal care effects and emphasize the effects of genetic differences. We found significant correlations between anxiety-like behavioral measures and physical performance measures which are not traditionally associated with anxiety-like behavior, and which differ between strains. Findings from this study should be taken into consideration when designing behavioral studies and choosing model organisms.},

M. provide compelling evidence that normal memory function depends on the medial temporal lobe, the full extent of his surgical resection has not been elucidated. We conducted magnetic resonance imaging studies to specify precisely the extent of his bilateral resection and to document any other brain abnormalities. The MRI studies indicated that the lesion was bilaterally symmetrical and included the medial temporal polar cortex, most of the amygdaloid complex, most or all of the entorhinal cortex, and approximately half of the rostrocaudal extent of the intraventricular portion of the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, hippocampus, and subicular complex). The collateral sulcus was visible throughout much of the temporal lobe, indicating that portions of the ventral perirhinal cortex, located on the banks of the sulcus, were spared; the parahippocampal cortex (areas TF and TH) was largely intact. The rostrocaudal extent of the ablation was ∼5.4 cm (left) and 5.1 cm (right). The caudal 2 cm, approximately, of the hippocampus body (normal length, ∼4 cm) was intact, although atrophic. The temporal stem was intact. Outside the temporal lobes, the cerebellum demonstrated marked atrophy, and the mammillary nuclei were shrunken. The lateral temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe cortices appeared normal for age 66 years. The mediodorsal thalamic nuclei showed no obvious radiological changes. These findings reinforce the view that lesions of the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical structures can produce global and enduring amnesia and can exacerbate amnesia beyond that seen after more selective hippocampal lesions.},

  abstract = {What makes humans unique? This question has fascinated scientists and philosophers for centuries and it is still a matter of intense debate. Nowadays, human brain expansion during evolution has been acknowledged to explain our empowered cognitive capabilities. The drivers for such accelerated expansion remain, however, largely unknown. In this sense, studies have suggested that the cooking of food could be a pre-requisite for the expansion of brain size in early hominins. However, this appealing hypothesis is only supported by a mathematical model suggesting that the increasing number of neurons in the brain would constrain body size among primates due to a limited amount of calories obtained from diets. Here, we show, by using a similar mathematical model, that a tradeoff between body mass and the number of brain neurons imposed by dietary constraints during hominin evolution is unlikely. Instead, the predictable number of neurons in the hominin brain varies much more in function of foraging efficiency than body mass. We also review archeological data to show that the expansion of the brain volume in the hominin lineage is described by a linear function independent of evidence of fire control, and therefore, thermal processing of food does not account for this phenomenon. Finally, we report experiments in mice showing that thermal processing of meat does not increase its caloric availability in mice. Altogether, our data indicate that cooking is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain hominin brain expansion.},

Building upon literatures focused on dynamics at the cellular level, we highlight that consolidation also transforms memories at the systems level to support future goal-relevant behavior, resulting in more generalized memory traces in the brain and behavior. We synthesize previous literatures spanning animal research, human cognitive neuroscience, and cognitive psychology to propose an integrative framework for adaptive consolidation by which goal-relevant memoranda are “tagged” for subsequent consolidation, resulting in selective transformations to the structure of memories that support flexible, goal-relevant behaviors.},

  abstract = {The high comorbidity of anxiety and depression suggests a potential degree of commonality in their etiologies. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model effectively replicates depressive-like phenotypes; however, the ability of CUS to produce anxiety-like behaviors has not been adequately addressed. Using the CUS paradigm (2 stressors per day for 10 days) in adult Sprague-Dawley rats we identified behavioral, hormonal, and neurochemical changes one day after the cessation of treatment. Stress attenuated weight gain throughout the study and increased locomotor activity one day after treatment, but had no effect on anxiety-behavior as measured by the elevated plus maze. In addition, plasma corticosterone levels were positively correlated with hypothalamic serotonin (5-HT) activity one day after stress treatment as determined by the ratio of the metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) to the parent compound (5-HIAA/5-HT ratio). These data suggest behavioral phenotypes associated with depression, but not comorbid anxiety, emerge in the immediate period after cessation of stress and that stress related physiology is related to 5-HT activity in the hypothalamus. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Here we investigate whether non-coding RNA broadly contributes to cytological-scale chromosome territory architecture. We develop a procedure that depletes soluble proteins, chromatin, and most nuclear RNA from the nucleus but does not delocalize XIST, a known architectural RNA, from an insoluble chromosome ‘‘scaffold.’’ RNA-seq analysis reveals that most RNA in the nuclear scaffold is repeat-rich, non-coding, and derived predominantly from introns of nascent transcripts. Insoluble, repeat-rich (C0T-1) RNA co-distributes with known scaffold proteins including scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), and distribution of these components inversely correlates with chromatin compaction in normal and experimentally manipulated nuclei. We further show that RNA is required for SAF-A to interact with chromatin and for enrichment of structurally embedded ‘‘scaffold attachment regions’’ prevalent in euchromatin. Collectively, the results indicate that long nascent transcripts contribute a dynamic structural role that promotes the open architecture of active chromosome territories.},

However, clinical and animal studies investigating the effects of intravenous ketamine on specific functional domains disrupted by depression reported conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent findings exploring the cognitive effects of ketamine in depression. METHODS: After a bibliographic search on PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo, we retrieved 11 original studies meeting our research criteria, 7 in humans with MDD or Treatment Resistant Disorder and 4 using rats models for depression. RESULTS: Overall the results showed that a) ketamine reduced activation and normalized connectivity measures of several brain regions related to depressive behaviors and reversed deficits in cognitive flexibility and coping response strategy in rats with depressive features, and b) ketamine leads to a no significant impairment on neurocognitive functions in most of the studies, with only three studies observing improvements in speed of processing, verbal learning, sustained attention and response control, verbal and working memory. LIMITATIONS: The methodological heterogeneity, in terms of neuropsychological tests used and cognitive domain explored, of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies included showed no significant cognitive impairments in MDD patients after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, the results of the fMRI studies considered suggest that ketamine may have a normalizing effect on brain functions during attentional and emotional processing in MDD patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary evidences.},

As such, scholars from a wide range of fields have taken great interest in the role that subsistence has played in both human cultural and biological evolution. Central to this discussion is the diet composition and nutrition of contemporary hunters and gatherers, who are frequently conscripted as model populations for ancestral human nutrition. Research among the world's few remaining foraging populations is experiencing a resurgence, as they are making the final transition away from diets composed of wild foods, to those dominated by domesticated cultigens and/or processed foods. In an effort to glean as much information as possible, before such populations are no longer hunting and gathering, researchers interested in the evolution of human nutrition are rapidly collecting and accessing new and more data. Methods of scientific inquiry are in the midst of rapid change and scholars are able to revisit long-standing questions using state of the art analyses. Here, using the most relevant findings from studies in ethnography, nutrition, human physiology, and microbiomes, we provide a brief summary of the study of the evolution of human nutrition as it has specifically pertained to data coming from living hunter-gatherers. In doing so, we hope to bridge the disciplines that are currently invested in research on nutrition and health among foraging populations.},

What the paper adds to existing knowledge? Participants described how in order to receive help they had to engage with a medical pathway in which their experiences were constructed as arising from a biochemical deficit. Antidepressant prescribing was identified as being the only option available and was associated with stigma. What are the implications for practice? Mental health nurses have a role to play in providing treatment options for those experiencing depression. Mental health nurses need to provide evidence-based information about antidepressants support those experiencing depression to make informed choices. Abstract Introduction There are increased prescribing rates of antidepressants associated with an increase in the diagnosis of depression. However, antidepressants are not effective for many people. There is a gap in the existing literature for a synthesis of the experiences of those with lived experience of antidepressant use to better understand their use and impact given their ubiquitous use in mental health, primary care and other secondary and tertiary care settings. Mental health nurses play direct or indirect roles in both advocating for antidepressant use and monitoring adherence. Aims To identify how people prescribed antidepressants describe their experiences of the medication including its discontinuation? Method A meta-synthesis of qualitative studies examining patients' experiences of antidepressant medication. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library databases were searched in May 2021. One reviewer screened titles and abstracts. Two reviewers independently reviewed the retrieved papers for eligibility and data extraction. The data synthesis was conducted using thematic analysis. Two reviewers independently conducted quality appraisals. Results Twenty-seven studies with a total of 2937 participants were identified for inclusion in this review. Four themes were identified across the studies: the only option available; stigma associated with ‘biochemical deficit’ not myself and the vicious cycle. Implications for practice Those seeking treatment for depression need to be provided with treatment options and evidence-based information about anti-depressants to provide them with the opportunity to make informed choices.},

  abstract = {The importance of the gut-brain axis in maintaining homeostasis has long been appreciated. However, the past 15 yr have seen the emergence of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis. This axis is gaining ever more traction in fields investigating the biological and physiological basis of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. The microbiota and the brain communicate with each other via various routes including the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, involving microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, and peptidoglycans. Many factors can influence microbiota composition in early life, including infection, mode of birth delivery, use of antibiotic medications, the nature of nutritional provision, environmental stressors, and host genetics. At the other extreme of life, microbial diversity diminishes with aging. Stress, in particular, can significantly impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis at all stages of life. Much recent work has implicated the gut microbiota in many conditions including autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Animal models have been paramount in linking the regulation of fundamental neural processes, such as neurogenesis and myelination, to microbiome activation of microglia. Moreover, translational human studies are ongoing and will greatly enhance the field. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to elucidate microbial-based intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Depressive disorders are complex, multifactorial mental disorders with unknown neurobiology. Numerous theories aim to explain the pathophysiology. According to the “gliocentric theory”, glial abnormalities are responsible for the development of the disease. The aim of this review article is to summarize the rapidly growing number of cellular and molecular evidences indicating disturbed glial functioning in depressive disorders. We focus here exclusively on the clinical studies and present the in vivo neuroimaging findings together with the postmortem molecular and histopathological data. Postmortem studies demonstrate glial cell loss while the in vivo imaging data reveal disturbed glial functioning and altered white matter microstructure. Molecular studies report on altered gene expression of glial specific genes. In sum, the clinical findings provide ample evidences on glial pathology and demonstrate that all major glial cell types are affected. However, we still lack convincing theories explaining how the glial abnormalities develop and how exactly contribute to the emotional and cognitive disturbances. Abnormal astrocytic functioning may lead to disturbed metabolism affecting ion homeostasis and glutamate clearance, which in turn, affect synaptic communication. Abnormal oligodendrocyte functioning may disrupt the connectivity of neuronal networks, while microglial activation indicates neuroinflammatory processes. These cellular changes may relate to each other or they may indicate different endophenotypes. A theory has been put forward that the stress-induced inflammation—mediated by microglial activation—triggers a cascade of events leading to damaged astrocytes and oligodendroglia and consequently to their dysfunctions. The clinical data support the “gliocentric” theory, but future research should clarify whether these glial changes are truly the cause or simply the consequences of this devastating disorder.},

  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices and applications have become ubiquitous over the last decade. However, it is unclear whether using GPS affects our own internal navigation system, or spatial memory, which critically relies on the hippocampus. We assessed the lifetime GPS experience of 50 regular drivers as well as various facets of spatial memory, including spatial memory strategy use, cognitive mapping, and landmark encoding using virtual navigation tasks. We first present cross-sectional results that show that people with greater lifetime GPS experience have worse spatial memory during self-guided navigation, i.e. when they are required to navigate without GPS. In a follow-up session, 13 participants were retested three years after initial testing. Although the longitudinal sample was small, we observed an important effect of GPS use over time, whereby greater GPS use since initial testing was associated with a steeper decline in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Importantly, we found that those who used GPS more did not do so because they felt they had a poor sense of direction, suggesting that extensive GPS use led to a decline in spatial memory rather than the other way around. These findings are significant in the context of society’s increasing reliance on GPS.},

In fact, given different confidence levels, a series of concentric bands can be obtained. To overcome the effect of confidence level on the error indicator, by introducing the union entropy theory, we propose an entropy error ellipse index of point, then extend it to line segment and polygon, and establish an entropy error band of line segment and an entropy error donut of polygon. The research shows that the entropy error index can be determined uniquely and is not influenced by confidence level, and that they are suitable for positional uncertainty of planar geometry features.},

We analyzed swim patterns of mice videotaped before and after training with a multi-trial procedure in the water maze. In addition to traditional parameters, the animals' position in relation to trained and other possible platform locations was estimated five times per second by an image analysis system. This parameter, cumulative distance to platform, was correlated with time spent in the platform quadrant but not with latency to and crossings of the platform location. We detected a subgroup of animals with concentric patterns within the group of spatial/persistent patterns. Random patterns were classified as well. Swim patterns before training were not predictive for the one after training. In summary, image analysis systems have made it very convenient to quantify behavior. Using their capacity, we have further improved the analysis of swim patterns, revealing animals' different approaches to solve a problem.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is a critical brain substrate for learning and memory; events that harm the hippocampus can seriously impair mental and behavioral functioning. Hippocampal pathophysiologies have been identified as potential causes and effects of a remarkably diverse array of medical diseases, psychological disorders, and environmental sources of damage. It may be that the hippocampus is more vulnerable than other brain areas to insults that are related to these conditions. One purpose of this review is to assess the vulnerability of the hippocampus to the most prevalent types of insults in multiple biomedical domains (i.e., neuroactive pathogens, neurotoxins, neurological conditions, trauma, aging, neurodegenerative disease, acquired brain injury, mental health conditions, endocrine disorders, developmental disabilities, nutrition) and to evaluate whether these insults affect the hippocampus first and more prominently compared to other brain loci. A second purpose is to consider the role of hippocampal blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in either causing or worsening the harmful effects of each insult. Recent research suggests that the hippocampal BBB is more fragile compared to other brain areas and may also be more prone to the disruption of the transport mechanisms that act to maintain the internal milieu. Moreover, a compromised BBB could be a factor that is common to many different types of insults. Our analysis indicates that the hippocampus is more vulnerable to insults compared to other parts of the brain, and that developing interventions that protect the hippocampal BBB may help to prevent or ameliorate the harmful effects of many insults on memory and cognition.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation is the process where labile memory traces become long-lasting, stable memories. Previous work has demonstrated that spatial memory consolidation, several days after training in a water maze had ceased, can be disrupted by a temporary intra hippocampal infusion of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate antagonist LY326325 (Riedel et al., 1999). Such reversible pharmacological techniques offer advantages over the permanent lesion studies that had first suggested a role for the hippocampus in memory consolidation. However, to date the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in such systems level processes remains controversial with evidence for impairments and augmentation of performance. Here we investigate the role of post-training hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade in rats and mice on the consolidation of weak and strong memory traces using an Atlantis water maze protocol. A hidden Atlantis platform was employed and rats (experiments 1 and 2) and mice (experiment 3) were required to dwell within 20cm of the trained location to activate and subsequently reveal the escape platform. In experiments 1 and 3 a strong memory trace was established by training rats or mice for several days in the water maze. In experiment 2 a significantly weaker trace was instituted by reducing the training period. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade was induced after the last training trial and continued for seven days. Reliable memory for the trained platform location in a retention test 15 days after the last training day demonstrated that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade did not affect memory consolidation in rats or mice. Our results also show that post-training N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade can lead to better performance in further retention tests conducted after the consolidation and drug administration period. Those data suggest that specific post-training N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade does not impair memory consolidation and it may also offer a memory trace mild protection from retrograde interference. © 2005 IBRO.

The C57BL/6 (B6) mouse is the most widely used inbred mouse strain in biomedical research; this is particularly so in behavioral studies. However, there are several C57BL substrains, all derived from common ancestors. C57BL/10 (B10) mice are superficially almost identical to B6 mice in appearance and behavior and widely used in inflammation and immunology research, yet rarely in behavioral studies. The present study assessed the comparability of behavioral results from these two strains, to determine whether they could be used interchangeably in future behavioral experiments. The results showed that the behavior of B6 mice clearly differed from that of B10 mice: in tests of cognition, species-typical behaviors, and motor coordination the B6 strain performed better. Consequently, B6 mice will probably remain the preferred choice for behavioral studies. Interpretation of results derived from the B10 strain should take into account its particular behavioral characteristics.},

Subsequently, these receptors were identified as mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) that are involved in appraisal processes, choice of coping style, encoding and retrieval. The MR-mediated actions on cognition are complemented by slower actions via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) on contextualization, rationalization and memory storage of the experience. These sequential phases in cognitive performance depend on synaptic metaplasticity that is regulated by coordinate MR- and GR activation. The receptor activation includes recruitment of coregulators and transcription factors as determinants of context-dependent specificity in steroid action; they can be modulated by genetic variation and (early) experience. Interestingly, inflammatory responses to damage seem to be governed by a similarly balanced MR:GR-mediated action as the initiating, terminating and priming mechanisms involved in stress-adaptation. We conclude with five questions challenging the MR:GR balance hypothesis.},

To better understand the neurobiological basis of mood and anxiety disorders, relevant animal models are needed. The corticosterone mouse model is frequently used to study depression. Chronic stress and accompanying glucocorticoid elevation causes pathological changes in the central nervous system, which are related to psychiatric symptoms. Exogenous administration of corticosterone is therefore often used to induce depressive-like behavior in mice and in some cases also features of anxiety-like behavior are shown. However, a thorough characterization of this model has never been conducted and housing conditions of the used subjects often differ between the implemented protocols. We chronically administered a subcutaneous corticosterone bolus injection to single- and group-housed mice, and we subsequently evaluated the face validity of this model by performing a battery of behavioral tests (forced swim test, mouse-tail suspension test, saccharin intake test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, elevated plus maze, light/dark paradigm and open field test). Our results show that corticosterone treatment has a substantial overall effect on depressive-like behavior. Increases in anxiety-like behavior on the other hand are mainly seen in single housed animals, independent of treatment. The current study therefore does not only show a detailed behavioral characterization of the corticosterone mouse model, but furthermore also elucidates the critical influence of housing conditions on the behavioral outcome in this model.},

The extent to which this physiological process continues into adulthood is an area of ongoing research. This study aimed to characterize markers of cell proliferation and assess the efficacy of antibodies used to identify neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the human brain. METHODS: Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were simultaneously examined in the SVZ and SGZ of 23 individuals aged 0.2-59 years, using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in combination with unbiased stereology. RESULTS: There was a marked decline in proliferating cells in both neurogenic niches in early infancy with levels reaching those seen in the adjacent parenchyma by 4 and 1 year of age, in the SVZ and SGZ, respectively. Furthermore, the phenotype of these proliferating cells in both niches changed with age. In infants, proliferating cells co-expressed neural progenitor (epidermal growth factor receptor), immature neuronal (doublecortin and beta III tubulin) and oligodendrocytic (Olig2) markers. However, after 3 years of age, microglia were the only proliferating cells found in either niche or in the adjacent parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a marked decline in neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches in early childhood, and that the sparse proliferating cells in the adult brain are largely microglia.},

  abstract = {Since the remarkable discovery of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian hippocampus, considerable effort has been devoted to unraveling the functional significance of these new neurons. Our group has proposed that a continual turnover of neurons in the DG could contribute to the development of event-unique memory traces that act to reduce interference between highly similar inputs. To test this theory, we implemented a recognition task containing some objects that were repeated across trials as well as some objects that were highly similar, but not identical, to ones previously observed. The similar objects, termed lures, overlap substantially with previously viewed stimuli, and thus, may require hippocampal neurogenesis in order to avoid catastrophic interference. Lifestyle factors such as aerobic exercise and stress have been shown to impact the local neurogenic microenvironment, leading to enhanced and reduced levels of DG neurogenesis, respectively. Accordingly, we hypothesized that healthy young adults who take part in a long-term aerobic exercise regime would demonstrate enhanced performance on the visual pattern separation task, specifically at correctly categorizing lures as “similar.” Indeed, those who experienced a proportionally large change in fitness demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in their ability to correctly identify lure stimuli as “similar.” Conversely, we expected that those who score high on depression scales, an indicator of chronic stress, would exhibit selective deficits at appropriately categorizing lures. As expected, those who scored high on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were significantly worse than those with relatively lower BDI scores at correctly identifying lures as “similar,” while performance on novel and repeated stimuli was identical. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that adult-born neurons in the DG contribute to the orthogonalization of incoming information.},

  abstract = {Cognitive flexibility is a term used to describe the brain processes underlying the phenomenon of adaptive change in behaviour in response to changed contingencies in the internal or external environment. Cognitive flexibility is often assessed in complex tasks measuring perceptual attentional shifting or response or task switching, but, arguably, reversal learning is a simple assay of cognitive flexibility. Reversal learning requires the detection of a changed outcome, the cessation of a previously-rewarded response and the selection of an alternative, previously-unrewarded, response. This study addressed the issue of the relationship between reversal learning and cognitive flexibility. In a single testing session, rats completed a series of 2-alternative forced-choice discriminations between digging bowls. The bowls differed according to both the medium within the bowl and the odor of the bowl. Having learned which cue (one of the odors or one of the digging media) indicated the food-baited bowl, half the rats were given additional trials of “over-training”. To test reversal learning, the meaning of the cues predictive of reward/non-reward was then switched. There was a robust effect of over-training, with over-trained rats performing reversal learning in fewer trials than rats trained to criterion only. The pattern of errors supported the hypothesis that more rapid reversing results from the formation of an attentional set. This is the same attentional mechanism that results in less rapid shifting or switching. We conclude that the behavioural flexibility demonstrated in reversal learning does not provide a scale on which cognitive flexibility can be measured.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is a vulnerable and plastic brain structure that is damaged by a variety of stimuli, e.g. hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hypoglycaemia, stress and seizures. Alzheimer's disease is a common and important disorder in which hippocampal atrophy is reported. Indeed, the available evidence suggests that hippocampal atrophy is the starting point of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and a significant number of patients with hippocampal atrophy will develop Alzheimer's disease. Studies indicate that hippocampal atrophy has functional consequences, e.g. cognitive impairment. Deposition of tau protein, formation of neurofibrillary tangles and accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) contributes to hippocampal atrophy together with damage caused by several other factors. Some of the factors associated with the development of hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease have been identified, e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, seizures, affective disturbances and stress, and more is being learnt about other factors. Hypertension can potentially damage the hippocampus through ischaemia caused by atherosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Diabetes can produce hippocampal lesions via both vascular and non-vascular pathologies and can reduce the threshold for hippocampal damage. Carriers of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-ε4 genotype have been shown to have greater mesial temporal atrophy and poorer memory functions than non-carriers. In addition to giving rise to abnormal lipid metabolism, the ApoE-ε4 allele can affect the course of Alzheimer's disease via both Aβ-dependent and -independent pathways. Repetitive seizures can increase Aβ-peptide production and cause neurotransmission dysfunction and cytoskeletal abnormalities or a combination of these. Affective disturbances and stress are proposed to increase corticosteroid-induced hippocampal damage in many different ways. In the absence of any specific markers for predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it seems appropriate to learn more about the various predictors of hippocampal atrophy that determine the progression of Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then attempt to address these. It would be interesting to know to what extent these predictors play a role in the development of MCI or hasten the conversion of MCI to full-blown Alzheimer's disease. Finally, it would be useful to know the extent to which these predictors can worsen or aggravate existing Alzheimer's disease. Of the clinically used drugs in Alzheimer's disease, anticholinesterases have been shown to slow down the rate of progression of hippocampal atrophy. One study observed that the neuroprotective effect of these agents is possibly due to an anti-Aβ effect produced by cholinergic stimulation. Similarly, antihypertensive and antihyperglycaemic drugs (pioglitazone and insulin) have been shown to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease or disease progression. Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies available for Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that for treatment to be most effective, the regimen must be started before significant downstream damage has occurred (i.e. before the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, at the stage of MCI or earlier). Since the hippocampus is a plastic structure and atrophy of this structure is closely related to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, if we could control blood pressure, regulate blood sugar, treat behavioural and psychological symptoms, achieve satisfactory lipid lowering and maintain a seizure-free state in patients with Alzheimer's disease, this may not only improve disease control but could also potentially affect the rate of disease progression.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze (MWM) was described 20 years ago as a device to investigate spatial learning and memory in laboratory rats. In the meanwhile, it has become one of the most frequently used laboratory tools in behavioral neuroscience. Many methodological variations of the MWM task have been and are being used by research groups in many different applications. However, researchers have become increasingly aware that MWM performance is influenced by factors such as apparatus or training procedure as well as by the characteristics of the experimental animals (sex, species/strain, age, nutritional state, exposure to stress or infection). Lesions in distinct brain regions like hippocampus, striatum, basal forebrain, cerebellum and cerebral cortex were shown to impair MWM performance, but disconnecting rather than destroying brain regions relevant for spatial learning may impair MWM performance as well. Spatial learning in general and MWM performance in particular appear to depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting a functionally integrated neural network. Finally, the MWM task has often been used in the validation of rodent models for neurocognitive disorders and the evaluation of possible neurocognitive treatments. Through its many applications, MWM testing gained a position at the very core of contemporary neuroscience research. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {No scientific conclusion follows automatically from a statistically non-significant result, yet people routinely use non-significant results to guide conclusions about the status of theories (or the effectiveness of practices). To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

Different memory processes have been described to be  significantly and positively impacted. Objective: Our objective is to explore the  potential of these Salvia, and their additional activities, in healthy  situations, and during prolonged administration, on memory and subsequent  mechanisms of action related to putative effects. Design: This mouse study has  implicated four investigational arms dedicated to control, Salvia officinalis  aqueous extract, Salvia lavandulaefolia-encapsulated essential oil and a mix  thereof (Cognivia™) for 2 weeks of administration. Cognitive functions have been  assessed throughout Y-maze and Morris water maze models. The impact of  supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, neuronal  activity, neurotrophins, neurotrophin receptors, CaM kinase II and glucocorticoid  receptors has been assessed via post-interventional tissue collection. Results:  All Salvia groups had a significant effect on Y-maze markers on day 1 of  administration. Only the mix of two Salvia species demonstrated significant  improvements in Morris water maze markers at the end of administration.  Considering all biological and histological markers, we did not observe any  significant effect of S. officinalis, S. lavandulaefolia and a mix of Salvia  supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and neuronal plasticity  (neurogenesis, neuronal activity, neurotrophins). Interestingly, CaM kinase II  protein expression is significantly increased in animals supplemented with  Salvia. Conclusion: The activities of Salvia alone after one intake have been  confirmed; however, a particular combination of different types of Salvia have  been shown to improve memory and present specific synergistic effects after  chronic administration in healthy mice.},

  abstract = {Inferring causal effects of treatments is a central goal in many disciplines. The potential outcomes framework is a main statistical approach to causal inference, in which a causal effect is defined as a comparison of the potential outcomes of the same units under different treatment conditions. Because for each unit at most one of the potential outcomes is observed and the rest are missing, causal inference is inherently a missing data problem. Indeed, there is a close analogy in the terminology and the inferential framework between causal inference and missing data. Despite the intrinsic connection between the two subjects, statistical analyses of causal inference and missing data also have marked differences in aims, settings and methods. This article provides a systematic review of causal inference from the missing data perspective. Focusing on ignorable treatment assignment mechanisms, we discuss a wide range of causal inference methods that have analogues in missing data analysis, such as imputation, inverse probability weighting and doubly robust methods. Under each of the three modes of inference—Frequentist, Bayesian and Fisherian randomization—we present the general structure of inference for both finite-sample and super-population estimands, and illustrate via specific examples. We identify open questions to motivate more research to bridge the two fields.},

The study of individual variation requires tools for quantification and decomposition of phenotypic variation into between- and within-individual components. This is essential as variance components differ in their ecological and evolutionary implications. We provide an overview of how mixed-effect models can be used to partition variation in, and correlations among, phenotypic attributes into between- and within-individual variance components. Optimal sampling schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and within-individual correlations, are detailed. Mixed-effect models enable the usage of unambiguous terminology for patterns of biological variation that currently lack a formal statistical definition (e.g. ‘animal personality’ or ‘behavioural syndromes’), and facilitate cross-fertilisation between disciplines such as behavioural ecology, ecological physiology and quantitative genetics.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal excitatory synapses has been proposed as the cellular mechanism underlying spatial learning and memory. However, most previous studies have focused on the role of long-term potentiation (LTP) in learning and memory, and much less is known about the role of long-term depression (LTD). Here, we report that hippocampal-dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze facilitated hippocampal CA1 LTD induction in~vivo. The LTD can be blocked by systemic application of the selective GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 (6~mg/kg, i.p.) or a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA23Y (3~μmol/kg, i.p.) that interferes with the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. In addition, systemic or intrahippocampal administration of these two mechanistically and structurally distinct inhibitors impaired spatial reversal learning of a novel target location, when the hidden platform was moved to the quadrant opposite the initial target location. Notably, acute elevated-platform stress, which facilitates hippocampal LTD induction, enhanced both acquisition and retrieval of spatial reversal memory. The present study demonstrates that reversal learning is impaired by blocking hippocampal LTD, and enhanced by facilitating hippocampal LTD, suggesting that hippocampal LTD may be necessary and sufficient to mediate new information processing. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ‘Cognitive Enhancers’.},

  abstract = {For a wide range of biomedical approaches, an accurate estimate of the age of embryos or pups is important. Overnight mating is the method that is mostly used to establish timed pregnancies. The oestrus cycle in mice repeats every four to five days. So, not all females will get pregnant because they are not in oestrus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse whether polygamous mating could increase the rate of timed pregnancies per breeding cage and female. We compared overnight timed mating regimes with up to four females per male, using C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice as well as F1 hybrids of these two strains. The number of vaginal plugs, number of females that gave birth and weaned litter (including size and weaning weight) were recorded. Our results showed that the plug and pregnancy rate decreased, but the productivity per breeding cage increased for polygamous mating regimes. The proportion of females with vaginal plugs and females that gave birth was significantly higher in monogamous mating. The proportion of plugged females that gave birth, as well as litter size and weaning weight, were not influenced by the mating regime. After analysing 513 breeding cages with a total of 1090 females, we found that polygamous mating with up to three females per male can increase the number of timed pregnancies. However, in the mating regime with more than three females, the rate of timed pregnancy as well as number of pups per female declined.},

  abstract = {Psilocybin has shown promise for the treatment of mood disorders, which are often accompanied by cognitive dysfunction including cognitive rigidity. Recent studies have proposed neuropsychoplastogenic effects as mechanisms underlying the enduring therapeutic effects of psilocybin. In an open-label study of 24 patients with major depressive disorder, we tested the enduring effects of psilocybin therapy on cognitive flexibility (perseverative errors on a set-shifting task), neural flexibility (dynamics of functional connectivity or dFC via functional magnetic resonance imaging), and neurometabolite concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in brain regions supporting cognitive flexibility and implicated in acute psilocybin effects (e.g., the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC). Psilocybin therapy increased cognitive flexibility for at least 4 weeks post-treatment, though these improvements were not correlated with the previously reported antidepressant effects. One week after psilocybin therapy, glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations were decreased in the ACC, and dFC was increased between the ACC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Surprisingly, greater increases in dFC between the ACC and PCC were associated with less improvement in cognitive flexibility after psilocybin therapy. Connectome-based predictive modeling demonstrated that baseline dFC emanating from the ACC predicted improvements in cognitive flexibility. In these models, greater baseline dFC was associated with better baseline cognitive flexibility but less improvement in cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between cognitive and neural flexibility. Whereas some enduring increases in neural dynamics may allow for shifting out of a maladaptively rigid state, larger persisting increases in neural dynamics may be of less benefit to psilocybin therapy.},

We asked if adult-born granule cells (GCs) might act to regulate processing within the DG by modulating the substantially more abundant mature GCs. Optogenetic stimulation of a cohort of young adult-born GCs (0 to 7 weeks post-mitosis) revealed that these cells activate local GABAergic interneurons to evoke strong inhibitory input to mature GCs. Natural manipulation of neurogenesis by aging-to decrease it-and housing in an enriched environment-to increase it-strongly affected the levels of inhibition. We also demonstrated that elevating activity in adult-born GCs in awake behaving animals reduced the overall number of mature GCs activated by exploration. These data suggest that inhibitory modulation of mature GCs may be an important function of adult-born hippocampal neurons. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The authors found that female mice that had been exposed to an acute psychological stress session had a decreased glucocorticoid response to a second homotypic stressor. In contrast, multiple psychological stress sessions led to increased glucocorticoid release in female mice. Acute injection(s) of saline in male mice and of cyclodextrin in female mice led to transient lymphocytopenia.

The chapter considers this work, and updates their review of the findings from experiments in which the hippocampus is removed. It concludes with a consideration of alternative views of the hippocampus, and the evidence of impaired spatial abilities in human amnesiacs.},

It will affect 20\% of individuals with considerable economic impacts. Unfortunately, 30–50\% of depressed individuals are resistant to current antidepressant treatments.               MDD               is twice as prevalent in women and associated symptoms are different. Depression's main environmental risk factor is chronic stress, and women report higher levels of stress in daily life. However, not every stressed individual becomes depressed, highlighting the need to identify biological determinants of stress vulnerability but also resilience. Based on a reverse translational approach, rodent models of depression were developed to study the mechanisms underlying susceptibility vs resilience. Indeed, a subpopulation of animals can display coping mechanisms and a set of biological alterations leading to stress resilience. The aetiology of               MDD               is multifactorial and involves several physiological systems. Exacerbation of endocrine and immune responses from both innate and adaptive systems are observed in depressed individuals and mice exhibiting depression‐like behaviours. Increasing attention has been given to neurovascular health since higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is found in               MDD               patients and inflammatory conditions are associated with depression, treatment resistance and relapse. Here, we provide an overview of endocrine, immune and vascular changes associated with stress vulnerability vs. resilience in rodents and when available, in humans. Lack of treatment efficacy suggests that neuron‐centric treatments do not address important causal biological factors and better understanding of stress‐induced adaptations, including sex differences, could contribute to develop novel therapeutic strategies including personalized medicine approaches.},

Animal models sensitive to chronic, but not acute, antidepressant treatment are greatly needed for studying antidepressant mechanisms. We initially assessed four inbred mouse strains for their behavioral response to chronic treatment with the selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (0, 5, 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water), which is used for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Only the highly anxious BALB/c strain exhibited sensitivity to fluoxetine in the forced swim test. Additionally, fluoxetine reduced locomotion in C57BL/6 and 129SvEv, but not BALB/c and DBA/2, strains. We then evaluated the effects of subchronic (∼4 days) and chronic (∼24 days) fluoxetine treatment (0, 10, 18, 25 mg/kg/day) on measures of anxiety and depression in BALB/c mice. Anxiety measures were obtained using the open field and novelty-induced hypophagia tests. Antidepressant effects were evaluated using the forced swim test. We found 18 mg/kg/day of chronic fluoxetine to be active in all three paradigms; subchronic treatment had no effect. Anxiety-related measures were reduced by 18 mg/kg/day. In the forced swim test, 10 and 18 mg/kg/day increased swimming and reduced immobility. Here we present several novel effects of chronic, but not subchronic, antidepressant treatment.},

Recent studies from our laboratory and others demonstrate that chronic administration of an antidepressant, including either a 5-HT or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitor, up-regulates neurogenesis in adult rodent hippocampus. Up-regulation of neurogenesis could block or reverse the effects of stress on hippocampal neurons, which include down-regulation of neurogenesis, as well as atrophy. The possibility that the cAMP signal transduction cascade contributes to the regulation of neurogenesis by antidepressants is supported by previous studies and by recent work. Although additional studies must be conducted to determine the significance of adult neurogenesis in humans, these findings will stimulate new avenues of research to identify the cellular and molecular basis of stress-related mood disorders as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress can alter the immune system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis and induce anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour in rodents. However, previous studies have not discriminated between the effect(s) of different types of stress on these behavioural and biological outcomes. We investigated the effect(s) of repeated injection vs. permanent social isolation on behaviour, stress responsivity, immune system functioning and hippocampal neurogenesis, in young adult male mice, and found that the type of stress exposure does indeed matter. Exposure to 6 weeks of repeated injection resulted in an anxiety-like phenotype, decreased systemic inflammation (i.e., reduced plasma levels of TNFα and IL4), increased corticosterone reactivity, increased microglial activation and decreased neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG). In contrast, exposure to 6 weeks of permanent social isolation resulted in a depressive-like phenotype, increased plasma levels of TNFα, decreased plasma levels of IL10 and VEGF, decreased corticosterone reactivity, decreased microglial cell density and increased cell density for radial glia, s100β-positive cells and mature neuroblasts—all in the DG. Interestingly, combining the two distinct stress paradigms did not have an additive effect on behavioural and biological outcomes, but resulted in yet a different phenotype, characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour, decreased plasma levels of IL1β, IL4 and VEGF, and decreased hippocampal neuronal differentiation, without altered neuroinflammation or corticosterone reactivity. These findings demonstrate that different forms of chronic stress can differentially alter both behavioural and biological outcomes in young adult male mice, and that combining multiple stressors may not necessarily cause more severe pathological outcomes.},

  abstract = {Cataloguing the effects of different types of stress on behaviour and physiology in rodent models has not been comprehensively attempted. Here, we systematically review whether chronic exposure to physical stress, psychosocial stress, or both types of stress can induce different behavioural and neurobiological outcomes in male and female rodents. We found that physical stress consistently increased depressive-like behaviour, impaired social interaction and decreased body weight, while psychosocial stress consistently increased both anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour, impaired social interaction and learning and memory, increased HPA axis activity, peripheral inflammation and microglial activation, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis in male rodents. Moreover, we found that the combined effect of both stress types resulted in a more severe pathological state defined by increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour, impaired social interaction and learning and memory, increased HPA axis activity and central inflammation, and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and neural plasticity in male rodents. Phenotypes for females were less consistent, irrespective of the type of stress exposure, on account of the limited number of studies using females. This review highlights that the type of stress may indeed matter and will help animal researchers to more appropriately choose a stress/depression model that fits their research purposes.},

Here, we show that spatial learning modifies neurogenesis by inducing a cascade of events that resembles the selective stabilization process characterizing development. Learning promotes survival of relatively mature neurons, apoptosis of more immature cells, and finally, proliferation of neural precursors. These are three interrelated events mediating learning. Thus, blocking apoptosis impairs memory and inhibits learning-induced cell survival and cell proliferation. In conclusion, during learning, similar to the selective stabilization process, neuronal networks are sculpted by a tightly regulated selection and suppression of different populations of newly born neurons.},

This adult neurogenesis has been proposed as a novel mechanism that mediates spatial memory. However, data showing a causal relationship between neurogenesis and spatial memory are controversial. Here, we developed an inducible transgenic strategy allowing specific ablation of adult-born hippocampal neurons. This resulted in an impairment of spatial relational memory, which supports a capacity for flexible, inferential memory expression. In contrast, less complex forms of spatial knowledge were unaltered. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons are necessary for complex forms of hippocampus-mediated learning.},

  abstract = {Studies in rats that assessed the relation of hippocampus-dependent learning and adult hippocampal neurogenesis suggested a direct regulatory effect of learning on neurogenesis, whereas a similar study in mice had not found such causal link. We here report a substantial decrease of BrdU-positive cells and other measures of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice trained in the hidden (HID) or cued version (VIS) of the Morris water maze as compared to untrained animals (CTR). Particularly, cells on advanced stages of neuronal development contributed to this decrease, whereas earlier progenitors (type 2 cells) were not diminished in HID, but were diminished in VIS as compared to CTR. The differential regulation of type 2 cells in HID and VIS may have been caused by a different degree of physical activity, given that a time-yoked control group did not differ from HID, and type 2 cells reportedly constitute the proliferative dentate gyrus population that primarily responds to physical activity. The decrease of hippocampal neurogenesis by water maze training was reversible by pre-exposing animals to the water maze prior to training, suggesting that stress associated with training may have caused the acute downregulation of adult neurogenesis. We propose that in mice the Morris water maze does not provide a pure enough learning stimulus to study the presumed effects of ‘learning’ on adult neurogenesis. In addition, however, our data show that physical activity that is intricately linked to many cognitive tasks in rodents might play an important role in explaining effects of learning on cellular hippocampal plasticity.},

Both normal rats and rats with fornix lesions (FX rats) acquired this task rapidly, although FX rats were slightly slower in achieving minimum escape latencies. In postcriterion testing, FX rats occasionally made near misses but, more often, their escape performance was indistinguishable from that of intact rats. Results from a variety of probe tests indicated that FX rats, like normal rats, had based their performance on a representation of multiple distal cues but their representation, unlike that of normal rats, was inflexible in that it could not be used to guide performance when the cues or starting position were altered. These results parallel those from other studies of hippocampal function in animals and humans: The learning deficit consequent to hippocampal system damage (1) is not specific to a particular category of learning materials, but is dependent on the representational demands of the task; (2) is observed when task demands encourage a representation based on relations among multiple cues, but not when the task encourages adaptation to an individual (or compound) stimulus; (3) spares acquisition of fundamental procedures needed to perform the task; and (4) impairs the flexible use of learned information in tests other than repetition of the learning experience.},

  abstract = {Depression-induced cognitive impairment has recently been given more attention in research. However, the relationship between depression and different types of memory is still not clear. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is a commonly used animal model of depression in which animals are exposed to chronic unpredictable environmental and psychological stressors, which mimics daily human life stressors. This study investigated the impact of different durations of CUMS on various types of memory (short- and long-term spatial memory and recognition memory) and investigated CUMS\&rsquo; impact on the ultrastructural level by histological assessment of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Twenty male C57BL/J6 mice (6 weeks old, 21.8 \&plusmn; 2 g) were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10): control and CUMS (8 weeks). A series of behavioral tasks were conducted twice at weeks 5\&ndash;6 (early CUMS) and weeks 7\&ndash;8 (late CUMS). A tail-suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST), elevated zero maze (EZM), elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), and sucrose-preference test (SPT) were used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. The cognitive function was assessed by the novel object recognition test (NORT; for recognition memory), Y-maze (for short-term spatial memory), and Morris water maze (MWM: for long-term spatial memory) with a probe test (for reference memory). Our data showed that 8 weeks of CUMS increased the anxiety level, reported by a significant increase in anxiety index in both EPM and EZM and a significant decrease in central preference in OFT, and depression was reported by a significant increase in immobility in the TST and FST and sucrose preference in the SPT. Investigating the impact of CUMS on various types of memory, we found that reference memory is the first memory to be affected in early CUMS. In late CUMS, all types of memory were impaired, and this was consistent with the abnormal histological features of the memory-related areas in the brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex).},

Although these practices have garnered interest in related fields, it remains unclear whether open science practices have been adopted in the field of communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This study aimed to survey the knowledge, implementation, and perceived benefits and barriers of open science practices in CSD. Method:  An online survey was disseminated to researchers in the United States actively engaged in CSD research. Four-core open science practices were examined: preregistration, self-archiving, gold open access, and open data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression models. Results:  Two hundred twenty-two participants met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were doctoral students (38\%) or assistant professors (24\%) at R1 institutions (58\%). Participants reported low knowledge of preregistration and gold open access. There was, however, a high level of desire to learn more for all practices. Implementation of open science practices was also low, most notably for preregistration, gold open access, and open data ({$<$} 25\%). Predictors of knowledge and participation, as well as perceived barriers to implementation, are discussed. Conclusion:  Although participation in open science appears low in the field of CSD, participants expressed a strong desire to learn more in order to engage in these practices in the future.

Until recently, the role of glial cells in the pathophysiology of mental diseases has largely been overlooked. However recently, multiple lines of evidence suggest more diverse and significant functions of glia with behavior-altering effects. The newly ascribed roles of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia have led to their examination in brain pathology and mental illnesses. Indeed, abnormalities in glial function, structure and density have been observed in postmortem brain studies of subjects diagnosed with mental illnesses. In this review, we discuss the newly identified functions of glia and highlight the findings of glial abnormalities in psychiatric disorders. We discuss these preclinical and clinical findings implicating the involvement of glial cells in mental illnesses with the perspective that these cells may represent a new target for treatment.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants have been shown to influence mitochondrial function directly, and suboptimal mitochondrial function (SMF) has been implicated in complex psychiatric disorders. In the current study, we used a mouse model for trait SMF to test the hypothesis that chronic fluoxetine treatment in mice subjected to chronic stress would negatively impact brain bioenergetics, a response that would be more pronounced in mice with trait SMF. In contrast, we hypothesized that chronic ketamine treatment would positively impact mitochondrial function in both WT and mice with SMF. We used an animal model for trait SMF, the Ndufs4GT/GT mice, which exhibit 25\% lower mitochondrial complex I activity. In addition to antidepressant treatment, mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). This paradigm is widely used to model complex behaviours expressed in various psychiatric disorders. We assayed several physiological indices as proxies for the impact of chronic stress and antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, we measured brain mitochondrial complex activities using clinically validated assays as well as established metabolic signatures using targeted metabolomics. As hypothesized, we found evidence that chronic fluoxetine treatment negatively impacted brain bioenergetics. This phenotype was, however, not further exacerbated in mice with trait SMF. Ketamine did not have a significant influence on brain mitochondrial function in either genotype. Here we report that trait SMF could be a moderator for an individual's response to antidepressant treatment. Based on these results, we propose that in individuals with SMF and comorbid psychopathology, fluoxetine should be avoided, whereas ketamine could be a safer choice of treatment.},

This increase in the production of new neurons may be required for the behavioral effects of antidepressants. However, it is not known which class of cells within the neuronal differentiation cascade is targeted by the drugs. We have generated a reporter mouse line, which allows identification and classification of early neuronal progenitors. It also allows accurate quantitation of changes induced by neurogenic agents in these distinct subclasses of neuronal precursors. We use this line to demonstrate that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine does not affect division of stem-like cells in the dentate gyrus but increases symmetric divisions of an early progenitor cell class. We further demonstrate that these cells are the sole class of neuronal progenitors targeted by fluoxetine in the adult brain and suggest that the fluoxetine-induced increase in new neurons arises as a result of the expansion of this cell class. This finding defines a cellular target for antidepressant drug therapies.},

  abstract = {The present report describes the emotional responses of different strains of mice to exposure to a novel open space model of anxiety using a 3D spatial navigation task. The 3D maze is modification of the radial maze with flexible arms that can be raised above or lowered below the horizontal level of a central platform. To access the arms animals need to cross a bridge linking the arms to the central platform. In this model, mice are exposed to novelty in an unfamiliar open space setting with no safe alternative. Fear from novelty is compounded with the need to explore. The drive to escape and the drive to approach are intermingled making this open space model radically different from the current models of anxiety which provide animals with the choice between safe and anxiogenic spaces. In a series of experiments, we examined the behaviour of different groups of mice from C57, C3H, CD1 and Balb/c strains. In the first experiment, different groups of C57 mice were tested in one of the three arms configurations. In the second experiment, C57 mice were compared to C3H mice. In the third experiment, C57 mice were compared to CD1 and Balb/c mice in the raised arm configuration over three successive sessions. In the fourth experiment, we examined the behaviour of C57 mice in the lowered arm configuration with an open and an enclosed central. In the final experiment, we examined the difference between C57 and C3H mice of both genders. Using several spatio-temporal parameters of the transition responses between central platform, bridges and arms, we have been able to show consistent results demonstrating significant differences between C57 and C3H mice, and between Balb/c and both C57 and CD1 mice. C3H appear more anxious than C57 mice, and Balb/c mice seem more anxious than C57 and CD1 mice. We also observed significant differences between sexes in C3H mice but not in C57 mice. C3H male mice appear more anxious than C3H female mice and than both C57 male and female mice. In the lowered arm configuration with an enclosed central platform, C57 mice took longer time to make a first entry to an arm, made more visits to bridges before first entry to an arm and required longer time between re-entries to arms, spent longer time on the central platform and shorter time on arms compared to mice in the other arm configurations. They also made frequent entries to the centre and bridges compared to mice in the lowered arm with an open central platform. These results demonstrate not only the sensitivity of the parameters of the test but also the consistencies and concordances of the results which make this 3D maze a valuable new tool in the study of the underlying neural mechanisms of anxiety responses in addition to learning and memory, and in assessing the effects of potential anxiolytic drugs. In this report we examine methodological issues related to the design of animal behavioural paradigms and question the value and the construct validity of the current models of human anxiety.},

Numerous reviews have repeatedly reported their lack of consistency and reliability but they failed to address the core question of whether these tests do provide unequivocal measures of fear-induced anxiety, that these measurements are not confused with measures of fear-induced avoidance or natural preference responses - i.e. discriminant validity. In the present report, I examined numerous issues that undermine the validity of the current tests, and I highlighted various flaws in the aspects of these tests and the methodologies pursued.

By manipulating levels of hippocampal neurogenesis, here we show that neurogenesis regulates this form of proactive interference. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis weakens existing memories and, in doing so, facilitates the encoding of new, conflicting (but not non-conflicting) information in mice. Conversely, decreasing neurogenesis stabilizes existing memories, and impedes the encoding of new, conflicting information.

Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit adults, and physical activity training increases hippocampal perfusion, but the extent to which aerobic exercise training can modify hippocampal volume in late adulthood remains unknown. Here we show, in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults, that aerobic exercise training increases the size of the anterior hippocampus, leading to improvements in spatial memory. Exercise training increased hippocampal volume by 2\%, effectively reversing age-related loss in volume by 1 to 2 y. We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.},

The current psychiatric diagnostic systems do not include any systematic characterization in regard to neu-robiological processes that reveal the clinical picture in individuals who got psychiatric diagnosis. It is obvious that further research in different areas is needed to understand the psychopathology. The problems in the functions of immune system and the correlation of neu-roinflammatory processes with psychiatric disorders have been one of the main research topics of psychiatry in recent years and have contributed to our understanding of psychopathology. Recent advances in the fields of immunology and genetics as well as rapidly increasing knowledge on the effects of immunological processes on brain functions have drawn attention to the correlations between psychiatric disorders and immune system dysfunctions. There are still unfilled gaps in the biology, pathophysiology, and treatment of major depressive disorder, which is quite prevalent among the psychiatric disorders, can lead to significant disability, and frequently has a recurrent course. It appears that low-grade chronic neuroinflammation plays a key role in forming a basis for the interaction between psychological stress, impaired gut microbiota and major depressive disorder. In this review, the role of neuroinflammation in the etiopathogene-sis of depression and the mechanism of action of the gut-brain axis that leads to this are discussed in the light of current studies.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that antidepressants (ADs) in major depressive disorder (MDD) are only slightly superior to placebo. However, in practice, ADs are the main clinical resource, and switching and augmentation strategies are frequently used in case of failure of the first treatment attempt. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study was conducted to validate this practice. This study is the largest and the most influential about using ADs in real practice and is the object of this paper. The published STAR*D findings supported the prevailing model. They justified an aggressive use of ADs in doses and duration, step-by-step switching and augmentation strategies, a sequential treat-to-remission care, a measurement-based treatment applicable in Primary Care, and a long-term maintenance of those doses that were effective in the acute phase. The published STAR*D articles and data showed significant biases and inconsistent data. E. Pigott obtained the protocol and study data, confirming these biases. Actual results are similar to ordinary treatment. The total number of maintained remissions published at 12 months follow-up was 67\%. Actual data indicates 2.7\%. The main clinical guidelines continue to recommend the model of step-by-step treatments with ADs. Some of them propose adapting it according to the severity of MDD, preferring psychological therapies in the less severe cases, treatable in Primary Care. All of them maintain the STAR*D as the primary basis for real-world use of ADs.},

When repeating the experiment several times, the changes in time (latency) and distance (path) taken to reach the platform are indicators for the learning and memory abilities of the rat. In juvenile toxicity studies, it is of interest to test whether dosing juvenile rats with some compound of interest has an effect on its learning ability. The traditional analysis uses non-parametric tests to check for a possible dose-effect. However, due to the many tests performed, this approach lacks power. Here, an alternative method is proposed, accounting for the longitudinal design of the study, the right-censoring of observations when animals did not find the platform and the correlation between the time and distance taken to reach the platform.

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an impairment of episodic memory, but the mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Animal models of MDD find impaired adult neurogenesis (AN) in the dentate gyrus (DG), and AN in DG has been suggested to play a critical role in reducing the interference between overlapping memories through pattern separation. Here, we study the effect of reduced AN in MDD on the accuracy of episodic memory using computational modeling. We focus on how memory is affected when periods with a normal rate of AN (asymptomatic states) alternate with periods with a low rate (depressive episodes), which has never been studied before. Also, unlike previous models of adult neurogenesis, which consider memories as static patterns, we model episodic memory as sequences of neural activity patterns. In our model, AN adds additional random components to the memory patterns, which results in the decorrelation of similar patterns. Consistent with previous studies, higher rates of AN lead to higher memory accuracy in our model, which implies that memories stored in the depressive state are impaired. Intriguingly, our model makes the novel prediction that memories stored in an earlier asymptomatic state are also impaired by a later depressive episode. This retrograde effect exacerbates with increased duration of the depressive episode. Finally, pattern separation at the sensory processing stage does not improve, but rather worsens, the accuracy of episodic memory retrieval, suggesting an explanation for why AN is found in brain areas serving memory rather than sensory function. In conclusion, while cognitive retrieval biases might contribute to episodic memory deficits in MDD, our model suggests a mechanistic explanation that affects all episodic memories, regardless of emotional relevance.},

  abstract = {MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), also known as ecstasy, is a popular drug often taken in environments rich in audio and visual stimulation, such as clubs and dance parties. The present experiments were conducted to test the notion that auditory stimulation influences the rewarding effects of MDMA. In Experiment 1, a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure was conducted in which rats received MDMA (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in a distinctive environment accompanied by music (65–75 dB), white noise (70 dB), or no added sound. Animals were pretreated with saline on alternating days in an alternate environment. Results revealed CPP in animals exposed to white noise during MDMA trials. For Experiment 2, rats from Experiment 1 had access to operant levers that delivered intravenous MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/inj) or saline (0.1 ml) on alternate days in the presence or absence of the same types of auditory stimuli as previously experienced. After three each of MDMA and non-reinforced (saline) sessions, animals were tested for NAcc DA and 5-HT responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) or saline under the same stimulus conditions. Findings revealed that NAcc DA and 5-HT increased after an MDMA injection, and both DA and 5-HT were significantly highest in animals exposed to music during the test session. These results indicate that paired sensorial stimuli can engage the same systems activated during drug use and enhance neurochemical and behavioral responses to MDMA administration.},

These conditional knockout mice were viable and grew normally, but they exhibited a pronounced deficiency in enrichment-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This reduction in neurogenesis did not result in appreciable learning deficits, indicating that addition of new neurons is not required for memory formation. However, our postlearning enrichment experiments lead us to postulate that adult dentate neurogenesis may play a role in the periodic clearance of outdated hippocampal memory traces after cortical memory consolidation, thereby ensuring that the hippocampus is continuously available to process new memories. A chronic, abnormal clearance process in the hippocampus may conceivably lead to memory disorders in the mammalian brain.},

  abstract = {Understanding how the brain translates a structured sequence of sounds, such as music, into a pleasant and rewarding experience is a fascinating question which may be crucial to better understand the processing of abstract rewards in humans. Previous neuroimaging findings point to a challenging role of the dopaminergic system in music-evoked pleasure. However, there is a lack of direct evidence showing that dopamine function is causally related to the pleasure we experience from music. We addressed this problem through a double blind within-subject pharmacological design in which we directly manipulated dopaminergic synaptic availability while healthy participants (n = 27) were engaged in music listening. We orally administrated to each participant a dopamine precursor (levodopa), a dopamine antagonist (risperidone), and a placebo (lactose) in three different sessions. We demonstrate that levodopa and risperidone led to opposite effects in measures of musical pleasure and motivation: while the dopamine precursor levodopa, compared with placebo, increased the hedonic experience and music-related motivational responses, risperidone led to a reduction of both. This study shows a causal role of dopamine in musical pleasure and indicates that dopaminergic transmission might play different or additive roles than the ones postulated in affective processing so far, particularly in abstract cognitive activities.},

  abstract = {The historical studies which have been carried out and are being carried out with the help of the methodology of research programmes define two types of relation between research programmes and the evidence. Let me call these types type A and type L respectively. They examine episodes where one research programme R″ replaces another research programme, R′ (or fails to be replaced by it), i.e. R′ is made the basis of research, argument, metaphysical speculation by the great majority of competent scientists. The authors find that the relation of R″ to the evidence is usually of type L while that of R′ to the evidence is of type A (other circumstances being present when this is not the case). Assuming their historical analysis to be correct this is an interesting sociological law. The authors do not present their results in such terms, however. Making A and L part of a normative methodology they claims to have shown that the acceptance of R″ was rational while the continued defence of R′ would have been irrational, and they express this belief of theirs by calling research programmes exhibiting relation L to the evidence progressive while research programmes which stand in relation A to the evidence are called degenerating. They also claim that such judgements are objective, independent of the whims and subjective convictions of the thinkers who make them. Using such a normative interpretation of their sociological results they also claim to possess arguments for and against well known research programmes. For example, they would say that today most versions of environmentalism degenerate and that it is irrational to continue working on them. Fortunately this puritanical superstructure of the otherwise excellent sociological studies need not be taken seriously. The reason is that the superstructure is arbitrary, or ‘subjective’ in at least five different ways. (1) the basic philosophy behind the normative apprisals makes modern science the source of the standards without giving reasons for the choice; (2) despite all its praise for modern science the methodology of research programmes uses a streamlined version of it without (a) making the principles of streamlining explicit and without (b) arguing for them; (3) the standards that are obtained via the arbitrary steps (1) and (2) are not strong enough to praise any action as ‘rational’ or condemn it as ‘irrational’ which means that such judgements are without support from the arbitrarily selected standards; (4) in some of the studies research programmes are selected in an idiosyncratic manner, the purpose being to make the general philosophy appear true (not that such truth would be of much use — see (3)); (5) the attempt to show that competent scientists always acted ‘rationally’ is not applied to all scientists but only to those whose actions seem to fit into the general methodology (for ‘seem’ see again item (3)). The superstructure of rationality which is subjective in the five ways just enumerated is supposed to guide scientists while the case studies are to show that the guide has substance — he is not merely a philosopher indulging in abstract dreams of law and order. The alleged substantiality is moonshine and one can reject the standards just as arbitrarily as they have been introduced. In sum: in the case studies we have (a) the discussion of certain sociological regularities; (b) the proposal of arbitrary standards which have no practical force; (c) the insinuation that the regularities are not merely factual, but are features of rationality, that they lend support to the standards and are justified by them, (a) may be accepted with the caution we extend to any new ‘discovery’ in sociology, (c) must be rejected (and with it the tendentious terminology used in all the case studies), (b) may be accepted, or rejected, depending on mood, the weather etc. Environmentalists, however, may continue on their path, for no argument has been raised against their enterprise.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a stress-linked disease with significant morbidity and the anesthetic drug ketamine is of growing interest in the treatment of depression, since in responsive individuals a single dose has rapid (within hours) antidepressant effects that can be sustained for over a week in some instances. This combination of fast action and a therapeutic effect that lasts far beyond the drug’s half-life points to a unique mechanism of action. In this reverse translational study, we investigate the degree to which ketamine counteracts stress-related depression-like behavioral responses by determining whether it affects unstressed animals similarly to stressed mice. To test this, male C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of vehicle (0.9\% saline; i.p.), 10 mg/kg ketamine, or 30 mg/kg ketamine, and were tested in the forced swim test (FST) 24 hours and 7 days later, as well as in the open field test on the eighth day. Unstressed mice had normal group housing, environmental enrichment, and experimenter pre-handling (5 days), whereas stressed animals were subjected to chronic mild stress (single housing, reduced enrichment and minimal handling), where some mice also had daily two-week unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). We find that ketamine (24 hours post-injection) decreases immobility and increases mobile (swimming) behavior (antidepressant-like effects) in UCS animals but does the opposite in unstressed mice, similar to recent human findings. In summary, these data suggest that chronic psychological stress interacts with ketamine treatment to modulate its effects in the C57BL/6J mouse FST, which reinforces the relevance of this test, and this strain of mice, to human, stress-induced depression.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a stress-linked disease with significant morbidity and the anesthetic drug ketamine is of growing interest in the treatment of depression, since in responsive individuals a single dose has rapid (within hours) antidepressant effects that can be sustained for over a week in some instances. This combination of fast action and a therapeutic effect that lasts far beyond the drug’s half-life points to a unique mechanism of action. In this reverse translational study, we investigate the degree to which ketamine counteracts stress-related depression-like behavioral responses by determining whether it affects unstressed animals similarly to stressed mice. To test this, male C57BL/6J mice were given a single injection of vehicle (0.9\% saline; i.p.), 10 mg/kg ketamine, or 30 mg/kg ketamine, and were tested in the forced swim test (FST) 24 hours and 7 days later, as well as in the open field test on the eighth day. Unstressed mice had normal group housing, environmental enrichment, and experimenter pre-handling (5 days), whereas stressed animals were subjected to chronic mild stress (single housing, reduced enrichment and minimal handling), where some mice also had daily two-week unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). We find that ketamine (24 hours post-injection) decreases immobility and increases mobile (swimming) behavior (antidepressant-like effects) in UCS animals but does the opposite in unstressed mice, similar to recent human findings. In summary, these data suggest that chronic psychological stress interacts with ketamine treatment to modulate its effects in the C57BL/6J mouse FST, which reinforces the relevance of this test, and this strain of mice, to human, stress-induced depression.},

  abstract = {Background: The DSM-5 features hundreds of diagnoses comprising a multitude of symptoms, and there is considerable repetition in the symptoms among diagnoses. This repetition undermines what we can learn from studying individual diagnostic constructs because it can obscure both disorder- and symptom-specific signals. However, these lost opportunities are currently veiled because symptom repetition in the DSM-5 has not been quantified.  Method: This descriptive study mapped the repetition among the 1,419 symptoms described in 202 diagnoses of adult psychopathology in Section II of the DSM-5. Over a million possible symptom comparisons needed to be conducted, for which we used both qualitative content coding and natural language processing. Results: In total, we identified 628 distinct symptoms: 397 symptoms (63.2\%) were unique to a single diagnosis, whereas 231 symptoms (36.8\%) repeated across multiple diagnoses a total of 1022 times (median 3 times per symptom; range 2-22). Some chapters had more repetition than others: For example, every symptom of every diagnosis in the Bipolar and Related Disorders chapter was repeated in other chapters, but there was no repetition for any symptoms of any diagnoses in the Elimination Disorders, Gender Dysphoria, or Paraphilic Disorders. The most frequently repeated symptoms included insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability—listed in 22, 17, and 16 diagnoses, respectively. Notably, the top 15 most frequently repeating diagnostic criteria were dominated by symptoms of major depressive disorder. Conclusion: Overall, our findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of the extent and potential consequences of symptom overlap.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prominent cause of disability worldwide. Current antidepressant drugs produce full remission in only about one-third of MDD patients and there are no biomarkers to guide physicians in selecting the best treatment for individuals. There is an urgency to learn more about the etiology of MDD and to identify new targets that will lead to improved therapy and hopefully aid in predicting and preventing MDD. There has been extensive interest in the roles of the immune system and the gut microbiome in MDD and in how these systems interact. Gut microbes can contribute to the nature of immune responses, and a chronic inflammatory state may lead to increased responsiveness to stress and to development of MDD. The gut microbiome-immune system-brain axis is bidirectional, is sensitive to stress and is important in development of stress-related disorders such as MDD. Communication between the gut and brain involves the enteric nervous system (ENS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine signaling systems and the immune system, and all of these can interact with the gut microbiota. Preclinical studies and preliminary clinical investigations have reported improved mood with administration of probiotics and prebiotics, but large, carefully controlled clinical trials are now necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in treating MDD. The roles that several gut microbe-derived molecules such as neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids and tryptophan play in MDD are reviewed briefly. Challenges and potential future directions associated with studying this important axis as it relates to MDD are discussed.},

The weakly electric fish, Gymnotus Carapo, uses their active electric sense for spatial navigation. The electric organ discharge rate (EODr) undergoes transient increases during navigation to enhance electrosensory sampling. Gymnotus also uses stereotyped forward/ backward swimming as a second form of active sensing that brings objects towards the electroreceptor-dense head region. We wirelessly recorded neural activity from the pallium of freely swimming Gymnotus. Spiking activity was sparse and occurred only during swimming. Notably, some units exhibited significant place specificity and/or association with both forms of active sensing. Our results provide the first characterization of neural activity in a hippocampallike region of a teleost fish brain and connects active sensing via sensory sampling rate and directed movements to higher order encoding of spatial information.},

At each site the amplitude and duration of action potential spikes, frequency of firing, relation to slow wave theta rhythm, and presence of complex spikes or theta cells was recorded. One thousand and fourteen neurons were recorded from. (When recording from many neurons simultaneously, the “number” of the neurons was “counted” in an arbitrary and approximate way.) Of 949 nontheta cells greater than 80 μV amplitude, only one was not in the hilus of fascia dentata or in a layer of cells which overlapped stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum. These are the locations of the cell bodies of projection cells (pyramidal cells and granule cells). However, this layer is, up to 400 μm thicker than stratum pyramidale. Theta cells were seen in sites of cell bodies of projection cells and also in stratum oriens of CA1, suprapyramidal layers of CA3, and dorsal part of the hilus of fascia dentata. The frequency of occurrence in these locations corresponded to the distribution of cell bodies of interneurons. We conclude that the class of projection cells and the class of nontheta cells have a very large overlap, and that the class of interneurons and the class of theta cells have a very large overlap.},

  abstract = {Hebbian plasticity is widely considered to be the mechanism by which information can be coded and retained in neurons in the brain. Homeostatic plasticity moves the neuron back towards its original state following a perturbation, including perturbations produced by Hebbian plasticity. How then does homeostatic plasticity avoid erasing the Hebbian coded information? To understand how plasticity works in the brain, and therefore to understand learning, memory, sensory adaptation, development and recovery from injury, requires development of a theory of plasticity that integrates both forms of plasticity into a whole. In April 2016, a group of computational and experimental neuroscientists met in London at a discussion meeting hosted by the Royal Society to identify the critical questions in the field and to frame the research agenda for the next steps. Here, we provide a brief introduction to the papers arising from the meeting and highlight some of the themes to have emerged from the discussions.

  abstract = {The Morris water maze (MWM) is one of the most commonly used tests for assessing spatial learning and memory in mice. While the MWM is highly amenable to testing the effects of memory modifying drugs, most studies do not consider the timing or duration of drug exposure when conducting the MWM assay; factors that can strongly influence the effect of the drug on different stages of memory and interfere with data interpretation. Herein we describe a MWM protocol which offers the advantage of distinguishing the impact of a fast acting intraperitoneally (IP) injected drug on the different stages of spatial memory: acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. Mice initially undergo habituation to both the MWM apparatus and IP injection procedure over the course of three days. For assessing the effect of a drug on memory acquisition, mice are injected with the drug prior to training sessions over four consecutive days, where mice learn to find an escape platform in a circular water tank using distal spatial cues. To determine the effect of the drug on memory consolidation, mice are injected with the drug immediately after each training session. For testing the effect of a drug on memory retrieval, mice receive mock IP injections on each training day and the drug is IP injected only once, prior to a probe trial, where mice attempt to locate the platform following its removal from the tank. This protocol provides a simple strategy for distinguishing the effect(s) of a CNS acting drug on the different stages of memory.},

  abstract = {The generation of new neurons in the hippocampus of adult mammals has become a widely accepted phenomenon, but the functional significance of the adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is not fully understood. One of the main hypotheses currently investigated suggests that neurogenesis contributes to pattern separation in the dentate gyrus. Many behavioral studies were conducted aiming to test this hypothesis using rodents as animal model. In those studies, researches ablated neurogenesis in the animals and subsequently evaluate them in tests of behavioral pattern separation, that is, behaviors that are thought to rely on the computational process of pattern separation. The results of these studies are varied, with most supporting a role for neurogenesis in pattern separation, but some others not. To address this controversy we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effect of neurogenesis ablation on behavioral pattern separation. Analysis results indicated that most of the literature in the topic is surprisingly consistent and, although there are two studies with divergent results, the bulk of the literature supports an effect of hippocampal neurogenesis on behavioral pattern separation. We discuss those findings in light of other behavioral effects of hippocampal neurogenesis ablation, limitations of behavioral data and other lines of evidence about the effect of hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.},

The chronic mild stress model (CMS) is one of the most extensively investigated animal models of chronic stress. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted in female rodents despite the markedly higher prevalence of major depression among women. Herein, we review CMS studies conducted in rats and mice of both sexes and further discuss intriguing sex-dependent behavioral and neurobiological findings. The PubMed literature search engine was used to find and collect all relevant articles analyzed in this review. Specifically, a multitermed search was performed with 'chronic mild stress', 'chronic unpredictable stress' and 'chronic variable stress' as base terms and 'sex', 'gender', 'females' and 'depression' as secondary terms in various combinations. Male and female rodents appear to be differentially affected by CMS application, depending on the behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological indices that are being measured. Importantly, the CMS paradigm, despite its limitations, has been successfully used to assess a constellation of interdisciplinary research questions in the sex differences field and has served as a 'silver bullet' in assessing the role of sex in the neurobiology of major depression. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

While DBA/2J, C57BL/6J and CD-1 mice typically learned the response readily, only 20\% of BALB/cByJ mice acquired the response. Commensurate with the effects of hippocampal disturbances, the performance deficits in BALB/cByJ mice were not evident when the position of the platform in the water-maze was cued. Exposure to uncontrollable foot shock did not affect the acquisition or performance of this response in the former three strains, but provoked a modest disruption of reversal performance in DBA/2J mice and markedly impaired reversal performance in BALB/cByJ mice. It seemed, however, that the response strategies adopted in these strains could be distinguished from one another. In the reversal paradigm BALB/cByJ mice initially persisted in returning to the original training quadrant rather than to the new goal quadrant. Following 2 days of training the perseveration was no longer apparent and animals seemed to adopt a random search strategy. In contrast, DBA/2J mice, which exhibited a smaller stress-induced disturbance, did not display a perseverative response style. These data suggest that inescapable shock does not disturb response-outcome associations, but may result from the induction of a perseverative response style. However, it appears that the mechanisms responsible for an interference of performance may not be uniform across strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

To investigate neurogenic potential and cellular diversity, we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes in five hippocampal-entorhinal subregions in humans, macaques, and pigs. Integrated cross-species analysis revealed robust transcriptomic and histologic signatures of neurogenesis in the adult mouse, pig, and macaque but not humans. Doublecortin (DCX), a widely accepted marker of newly generated granule cells, was detected in diverse human neurons, but it did not define immature neuron populations. To explore species differences in cellular diversity and implications for disease, we characterized subregion-specific, transcriptomically defined cell types and transitional changes from the three-layered archicortex to the six-layered neocortex. Notably, METTL7B defined subregion-specific excitatory neurons and astrocytes in primates, associated with endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet proteins, including Alzheimer's disease-related proteins.

Although psychological theories have postulated the existence of decay processes for declarative memory, the corresponding neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Here we develop the hypothesis that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis represents a decay process that continually clears memories from the hippocampus. As newborn granule cells integrate into established hippocampal circuits, they form new input and output connections over the course of several weeks. Because successful memory retrieval relies on reinvoking patterns of activity that occurred at the time of encoding (pattern completion), neurogenesis-induced remodeling of hippocampal circuits incrementally reduces the likelihood that a given retrieval cue will reinvoke a previously stored pattern.},

  abstract = {Brain plasticity as a neurobiological reflection of individuality is difficult to capture in animal models. Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of human monozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity data on 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratory activity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individual differences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roaming entropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively with individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show that factors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individual differences in structural brain plasticity and behavior. The paradigm introduced here serves as an animal model for identifying mechanisms of plasticity underlying nonshared environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior.},

  abstract = {Chronic, unresolved stress is a major risk factor for the development of clinical depression. While many preclinical models of stress-induced depression have been reported, the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol is an established translationally-relevant model for inducing behavioral symptoms commonly associated with clinical depression, such as anhedonia, altered grooming behavior, and learned helplessness in rodents. The UCMS protocol also induces physiological (e.g., hypercortisolemia, hypertension) and neurological (e.g., anhedonia, learned helplessness) changes that are clinically associated with depression. Importantly, UCMS-induced depressive symptoms can be ameliorated through chronic, but not acute, treatment with common SSRIs. As such, the UCMS protocol offers many advantages over acute stress protocols or protocols that utilize more extreme stressors. Our protocol involves randomized, daily exposures to 7 distinct stressors: damp bedding, removal of bedding, cage tilt, alteration of light/dark cycles, social stresses, shallow water bath, and predator sounds/smells. By subjecting rodents 3-4 hr daily to these mild stressors for 8 weeks, we demonstrate both significant behavioral changes and poor health outcomes to the cardiovascular system. This approach allows for in-depth interrogation of the neurological, behavioral, and physiological alterations associated with chronic stress-induced depression, as well as for testing of new potential therapeutic agents or intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Sertraline (Zoloft) and fluoxetine (Prozac) are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors whose antidepressant mechanism of action is classically attributed to an elevation of the extracellular levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. However, the biological effects of these drugs seem to be more complex than their traditionally described mechanism of action. Among their actions is the inhibition of different types of Na+ and K+ channels, as well as of glutamate uptake activity. The clearance of extracellular glutamate is essential to maintain the central nervous system within physiological conditions, and this excitatory neurotransmitter is removed from the synaptic cleft by astrocyte transporters. This transport depends upon a hyperpolarized membrane potential in astrocytes that is mainly maintained by Kir4.1 K+ channels. The impairment of the Kir4.1 channel activity reduces driving force for the glutamate transporter, resulting in an accumulation of extracellular glutamate. It has been shown that sertraline and fluoxetine inhibit Kir4.1 K+ channels. Recently, we demonstrated that sertraline reduces glutamate uptake in human platelets, which contain a high-affinity Na+-dependent glutamate uptake system, with kinetic and pharmacological properties similar to astrocytes in the central nervous system. Considering these similarities between human platelets and astrocytes, one might ask if sertraline could potentially reduce glutamate clearance in the synaptic cleft and consequently modulate glutamatergic transmission. This possibility merits investigation, since it may provide additional information regarding the mechanism of action and perhaps the side effects of these antidepressants.},

They have profound effects on mood and behavior and affect neurochemical transmission and neuroendocrine control. We have used the experimental paradigm of chronic psychosocial stress in tree shrews to investigate the impact of aversive social encounters on brain structures. Chronic stress in male tree shrews which is accompanied by constantly elevated levels of glucocorticoids leads to structural changes in hippocampal neurons. Whereas dendritic atrophy of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and impairment of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus could be demonstrated in chronically stressed tree shrews, a loss of hippocampal neurons was not observed in this animal model. The present review summarizes recent results on the question which structural changes occur during chronic stress in neurons of the brain and whether glucocorticoids might be responsible for such stress effects. The role of transmitter systems in stress-related neuronal plasticity is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hypermnesic condition that develops in a subset of individuals following exposure to severe trauma. PTSD symptoms are debilitating, and include increased anxiety, abnormal threat generalization, and impaired extinction. In developing treatment strategies for PTSD, preclinical studies in rodents have largely focused on interventions that target post-encoding memory processes such as reconsolidation and extinction. Instead, here we focus on forgetting, another post-encoding process that regulates memory expression. Using a double trauma murine model for PTSD, we asked whether promoting neurogenesis-mediated forgetting can weaken trauma memories and associated PTSD-relevant behavioral phenotypes. In the double trauma paradigm, consecutive aversive experiences lead to a constellation of behavioral phenotypes associated with PTSD including increases in anxiety-like behavior, abnormal threat generalization, and deficient extinction. We found that post-training interventions that elevate hippocampal neurogenesis weakened the original trauma memory and decreased these PTSD-relevant phenotypes. These effects were observed using multiple methods to manipulate hippocampal neurogenesis, including interventions restricted to neural progenitor cells that selectively promoted integration of adult-generated granule cells into hippocampal circuits. The same interventions also weakened cocaine place preference memories, suggesting that promoting hippocampal neurogenesis may represent a broadly useful approach in hypermnesic conditions such as PTSD and substance abuse disorders.},

  abstract = {Background Cognitive flexibility is a frontal lobe function, and some scholars have indicated that it is linked to depression. The Cognitive Flexibility Test (CFT) is a neuropsychological test that can easily and promptly measure cognitive flexibility within a short amount of time. This study focuses on healthy younger workers to determine the associations between their cognitive flexibility, depression, and performance at work. Methods The absolute absenteeism and the absolute presenteeism of a group of 80 regular employees were measured, and the employees were administered the Verbal Fluency Test (VTF), the CFT-A and CFT-B, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-2), and the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ). Google Forms were used to measure the BDI-2, absolute absenteeism, and absolute presenteeism, and online interviews were conducted on Zoom to collect answers to the CFT and the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT). Results No significant age-related differences appeared in the number of responses obtained for the CFT-A and CFT-B from subjects grouped according to the decades they represented, ranging from the 20s to the 50s. In addition, the CFT-A and CFT-B did not indicate significant correlations between the BDI-2 and absenteeism and presenteeism. Limitations Small sample, online vs. in person assessments due to COVID-19. Conclusion The results suggest that the function of cognitive flexibility is relatively stable and is unaffected by age brackets. The study also found no links between the cognitive flexibility of healthy young workers, the state of depression, or their work performance.},

It contains a variety of toxic tropane alkaloids such as atropine, hyoscamine, and scopolamine. In Eastern medicine, especially in Ayurvedic medicine, D. stramonium has been used for curing various human ailments, including ulcers, wounds, inflammation, rheumatism and gout, sciatica, bruises and swellings, fever, asthma and bronchitis, and toothache. A few previous studies have reported on the pharmacological effects of D. stramonium; however, complete information regarding the pharmacology, toxicity, ethnobotany and phytochemistry remains unclear. Ethnomedicinally, the frequent recreational abuse of D. stramonium has resulted in toxic syndromes. D. stramonium, in the form of paste or solution to relieve the local pain, may not have a deleterious effect; however, oral and systemic administration may lead to severe anticholinergic symptoms. For this reason, it is very important for individuals, mainly young people, to be aware of the toxic nature and potential risks associated with the use of this plant. This comprehensive review of D. stramonium includes information on botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and ethnomedicinal uses.},

Also described is the development of a learning index that provides a continuous, graded measure of the severity of age-related impairment in the task.

Arenas employed were the T-maze, the Morris water maze, the puzzle box, the Hebb–Williams maze, object exploration, a water plus-maze, and a second food-puzzle arena. The results show a factor structure consistent with the presence of g in mice. Employing one score per arena, this factor accounts for 41\% of the variance in the first study (or 36\% after sex regression) and 23\% in the second, where this factor also showed sibling correlations of 0.17–0.21, which translates into an upper-limit heritability estimate of around 40\%. Reliabilities of many tasks are low and consequently set an even lower ceiling for inter-arena or sibling correlations. Nevertheless, the factor structure is seen to remain fairly robust across permutations of the battery composition and the current findings fit well with other recent studies.},

However, how exposure to stressful context immediately after stress further modulates the physiological responses is not fully understood. Here, we found that acute stress inhibited paired-pulse facilitation in hippocampal slices of Wistar rats which were subjected to contextual fear conditioning. But such inhibition was reversed by subsequent prolonged exposure to foot-shock context or returning to home cage for 1 h. Interestingly, foot-shock stress-facilitated LTD induced by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses at 1 Hz) was maintained by subsequent exposure to foot-shock context but was reversed by returning to home cage environment. Moreover, plasma corticosterone level was still kept higher in rats exposed to foot-shock context but not to home cage. Findings suggest that remaining in stressful environment immediately after stress maintains acute stress-facilitated LTD and higher level of neuroendocrine response. Our results also contribute to further understanding the critical role of timely intervention in mediating stress-related aversive changes in human. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

The aim of this work was to compare the behavioral response of mice of the strains BALB/c and C57BL/6 to evaluate memory and learning as cognitive functions. Young male mice, 7–8 weeks of age, from each strain were used. Y maze, object recognition and passive avoidance tasks were performed. Both strains of mice showed differences in the response to the passive avoidance and Y maze task. This study advances knowledge about the baseline behavior of laboratory mice strains and their response during the experimental procedures, which are due to the treatment, genetic influence, procedural differences, genetic background variance, or any combination of these elements.},

  abstract = {Despite enormous progress in the past few years the specific contribution of newly born granule cells to the function of the adult hippocampus is still not clear. We hypothesized that in order to solve this question particular attention has to be paid to the specific design, the analysis, and the interpretation of the learning test to be used. We thus designed a behavioral experiment along hypotheses derived from a computational model predicting that new neurons might be particularly relevant for learning conditions, in which novel aspects arise in familiar situations, thus putting high demands on the qualitative aspects of (re-)learning. In the reference memory version of the water maze task suppression of adult neurogenesis with temozolomide (TMZ) caused a highly specific learning deficit. Mice were tested in the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze (6 trials per day for 5 days with a reversal of the platform location on day 4). Testing was done at 4 weeks after the end of four cycles of treatment to minimize the number of potentially recruitable new neurons at the time of testing. The reduction of neurogenesis did not alter longterm potentiation in CA3 and the dentate gyrus but abolished the part of dentate gyrus LTP that is attributed to the new neurons. TMZ did not have any overt side effects at the time of testing, and both treated mice and controls learned to find the hidden platform. Qualitative analysis of search strategies, however, revealed that treated mice did not advance to spatially precise search strategies, in particular when learning a changed goal position (reversal). New neurons in the dentate gyrus thus seem to be necessary for adding flexibility to some hippocampus-dependent qualitative parameters of learning. Our finding that a lack of adult-generated granule cells specifically results in the animal's inability to precisely locate a hidden goal is also in accordance with a specialized role of the dentate gyrus in generating a metric rather than just a configurational map of the environment. The discovery of highly specific behavioral deficits as consequence of a suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis thus allows to link cellular hippocampal plasticity to well-defined hypotheses from theoretical models.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has changed our view on the adult mammalian brain by adding a new kind of neuroplasticity with strong implications for cognition and behaviour of older mammals. Because the new neurons are found in the hippocampus, a structure well known to be the gateway to memory, adult neurogenesis appears to be of especially high relevance for humans. The integration of new neurons into existing and well-working networks depends on an intimate regulation of the divisions the putative stem cells undergo in the subgranular zone, the expansion of the precursor cell pool, the processes of maturation and differentiation, and, finally, the appropriate functional integration into the network of the dentate gyrus. While much progress has been made in the last decade on the genetic and molecular underpinnings of adult neurogenesis, as well as how these processes are regulated in the context of different ‘lifestyles’, its functional contribution remains unclear. From a clinical perspective, however, all the attention adult neurogenesis deserves depends on the specific functional contribution of the new neurons to hippocampal function. Only recently, a coherent picture is about to begin to emerge what the new neurons might be good for. Importantly, results from studies testing rodents in spatial learning paradigms suggest a similar role for adult neurogenesis in human spatial navigation. This chapter reviews the findings on the functional relevance of adult neurogenesis along with a recently published attempt to integrate the data into a common theoretical framework. Beside experimental data, results and implications from studies based on theoretical models regarding the function of the new neurons are considered.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze represents the de-facto standard for testing hippocampal function in laboratory rodents. In the field of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, however, using this paradigm to assess the functional relevance of the new neurons yielded surprisingly inconsistent results. While some authors found aspects of water maze performance to be linked to adult neurogenesis, others obtained different results or could not demonstrate any effect of manipulating adult neurogenesis. In this review we discuss evidence that the large diversity of protocols and setups used is an important aspect in interpreting the differences in the results that have been obtained. Even simple parameters such as pool size, number, and configuration of visual landmarks, or number of trials can become highly relevant for getting the new neurons involved at all. Sets of parameters are often chosen with implicit or explicit concepts in mind and these might lead to different views on the function of adult-generated neurons. We propose that the classical parameters usually used to measure spatial learning performance in the water maze might not be particularly well-suited to sensitively and specifically detect the supposedly highly specific functional changes elicited by the experimental modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. As adult neurogenesis is supposed to affect specific aspects of information processing only in the hippocampus, any claim for a functional relevance of the new neurons has to be based on hippocampus-specific parameters. We also placed a special emphasis on the fact that the dentate gyrus (DG) facilitates the differentiation between contexts as opposed to just differentiating places. In conclusion, while the Morris water maze has proven to be one of the most effective testing paradigms to assess hippocampus-dependent spatial learning, new and more specific questions ask for new parameters. Therefore, the full potential of the water maze task remains to be tapped. © 2013 Garthe and Kempermann.},

  abstract = {We here show that living in a stimulus-rich environment (ENR) improves water maze learning with respect to specific key indicators that in previous loss-of-function experiments have been shown to rely on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Analyzing the strategies employed by mice to locate the hidden platform in the water maze revealed that ENR facilitated task acquisition by increasing the probability to use effective search strategies. ENR also enhanced the animals’ behavioral flexibility, when the escape platform was moved to a new location. Treatment with temozolomide, which is known to reduce adult neurogenesis, abolished the effects of ENR on both acquisition and flexibility, while leaving other aspects of water maze learning untouched. These characteristic effects and interdependencies were not seen in parallel experiments with voluntary wheel running (RUN), a second pro-neurogenic behavioral stimulus. Since the histological assessment of adult neurogenesis is by necessity an end-point measure, the levels of neurogenesis over the course of the experiment can only be inferred and the present study focused on behavioral parameters as analytical endpoints. Although the correlation of physical activity with precursor cell proliferation and of learning and the survival of new neurons is well established, how the specific functional effects described here relate to dynamic changes in the stem cell niche remains to be addressed. Nevertheless, our findings support the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis is a critical mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of leading an active live, rich in experiences. © 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Non-competitive N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine are commonly and interchangeably used to model aspects of schizophrenia in animals. We compared here the effects of acute administration of these compounds over a range of pre-treatment times in tests of instrumental responding (VI 30. s response schedule), simple reaction time (SRT) and cognitive flexibility (reversal learning and attentional set shifting digging task) in rats. At standard pre-treatment times (15-30. min), both ketamine and PCP produced overall response suppression in VI 30 and increased reaction times in SRT suggesting that any concomitant cognitive performance deficits are likely to be confounded by motor and/or motivational changes. However, the use of extended pre-treatment times produced deficits in cognitive flexibility measured up to 4. h after drug administration in the absence of motor/motivational impairment. Generally, PCP increased impulsive responding in the SRT indicating a possible loss of inhibitory response control that may have contributed to deficits observed in reversal learning and attentional set-shifting. In contrast to PCP, ketamine did not have the same effect on impulsive responding, and possibly as a consequence produced more subtle cognitive deficits in attentional set-shifting. In summary, acute treatment with NMDAR antagonists can produce cognitive deficits in rodents that are relevant to schizophrenia, provided that motor and/or motivational effects are allowed to dissipate. The use of longer pre-treatment times than commonly employed might be advantageous. Also, ketamine, which is more frequently used in clinical settings, did not produce as extensive cognitive deficits as PCP. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.},

Whether adult-born neurons make unique contributions to brain functions is largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized synaptic plasticity of retrovirally labeled adult-born dentate granule cells at different stages during their neuronal maturation. We identified a critical period between 1 and 1.5 months of the cell age when adult-born neurons exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation with increased potentiation amplitude and decreased induction threshold. Furthermore, such enhanced plasticity in adult-born neurons depends on developmentally regulated synaptic expression of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. Our study demonstrates that adult-born neurons exhibit the same classic critical period plasticity as neurons in the developing nervous system. The transient nature of such enhanced plasticity may provide a fundamental mechanism allowing adult-born neurons within the critical period to serve as major mediators of experience-induced plasticity while maintaining stability of the mature circuitry.},

Here, we report that LTP and LTD in the hippocampal CA1 region of freely moving adult rats were prevented by NMDAR 2A (GluN2A) and 2B subunit (GluN2B) preferential antagonists, respectively. These results strongly suggest that NMDAR subtype preferential antagonists are appropriate tools to probe the roles of LTP and LTD in spatial memory. Using a Morris water maze task, the LTP-blocking GluN2A antagonist had no significant effect on any aspect of performance, whereas the LTD-blocking GluN2B antagonist impaired spatial memory consolidation. Moreover, similar spatial memory deficits were induced by inhibiting the expression of LTD with intrahippocampal infusion of a short peptide that specifically interferes with AMPA receptor endocytosis. Taken together, our findings support a functional requirement of hippocampal CA1 LTD in the consolidation of long-term spatial memory.},

  abstract = {The anesthetic drug ketamine has been successfully repurposed as an antidepressant in human subjects. This represents a breakthrough for clinical psychopharmacology, because unlike monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine has rapid onset, including in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that is resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy. This rapid therapeutic onset suggests a unique mechanism of action, which continues to be investigated in reverse translational studies in rodents. A large fraction of rodent and human studies of ketamine have focused on the effects of only a single administration of ketamine, which presents a problem because MDD is typically a persistent illness that may require ongoing treatment with this drug to prevent relapse. Here we review behavioral studies in rodents that used repeated dosing of ketamine in the forced swim test (FST), with an eye toward eventual mechanistic studies. A subset of these studies carried out additional experiments with only a single injection of ketamine for comparison, and several studies used chronic psychosocial stress, where stress is a known causative factor in some cases of MDD. We find that repeated ketamine can in some cases paradoxically produce increases in immobility in the FST, especially at high doses such as 50 or 100 mg/kg. Several studies however provide evidence that repeated dosing is more effective than a single dose at decreasing immobility, including behavioral effects that last longer. Collectively, this growing literature suggests that repeated dosing of ketamine has prominent depression-related effects in rodents, and further investigation may help optimize the use of this drug in humans experiencing MDD.},

  abstract = {The intestinal microbiota of an organism can significantly alter outcome data in otherwise identical experiments. Occasionally, animals may require sedation or anesthesia for scientific or health-related purposes, and certain anesthetics, such as ketamine, can profoundly affect the gastrointestinal system. While many factors can alter the gut microbiome (GM), the effects of anesthetics on the composition or diversity of the GM have not been established. The goal of the current study was to determine whether daily administration of ketamine would significantly alter the microbiome of CD1 mice. To achieve this goal, female CD1 mice received daily injections of ketamine HCl (100 mg/kg) or the equivalent volume of 0.9\% saline for 10 consecutive days. Fecal samples were collected before the first administration and 24 h after the final dose of either ketamine or saline. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing to identify changes between groups in diversity or composition of GM. The study found no significant changes to the GM after serial ketamine administration when treated mice were housed with controls. Therefore, ketamine administration is unlikely to alter the GM of a CD1 mouse and should not serve be a confounding factor in reproducibility of research.},

  abstract = {Dysfunction of the hippocampal formation manifests as impaired relational learning and memory in humans and animals. One of the most frequently applied relational learning paradigms in animals is the Morris water maze (MWM), in which the subject is required to learn complex spatial relationships of visual cues. MWM has been employed as a diagnostic tool to investigate effects of drugs and mutations. However, the validity of this test and its ability to properly detect hippocampal dysfunction have been questioned. In order to corroborate the role of hippocampus in spatial learning, we employed ibotenic acid lesioning and ablated the hippocampus bilaterally or unilaterally in mice, as ascertained by magnetic resonance imaging. We found a significant impairment in response to hippocampal disruption that was more pronounced in mice with bilateral lesion than with unilateral lesion. However, the results also indicated that even the mice with bilateral lesion could improve their performance, which confirms the notion that the MWM has an important nonhippocampal component. It is thus possible that experimental alteration of brain function does not manifest as modified performance in MWM, even when hippocampal function is modified (false-negative finding), or manifest as altered performance without varying hippocampal function (false-positive finding), possibilities that have important implications for studies using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the brain.

  abstract = {Background: Appreciable evidence suggest that dysbiosis in microbiota, reflected in gut microbial imbalance plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and inflammatory diseases. Recently, the antidepressant properties of ketamine have gained prominence due to its fast and long lasting effects. Additional uses for ketamine in inflammatory disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome have been suggested. However, ketamine's exact mechanism of action and potential effects on microbiome is not known. Here, we examined the effects of low dose ketamine, known to induce antidepressant effects, on stool microbiome profile in adult male Wistar rats. Animals (5/group) were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) or saline, daily for 7 days and sacrificed on day 8 when intestinal stools were collected and stored at - 80 °C. DNA was extracted from the samples and the 16 S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis was performed using 16S Metagenomics application. Results: At genus-level, ketamine strikingly amplified Lactobacillus, Turicibacter and Sarcina by 3.3, 26 and 42 fold, respectively. Conversely, opportunistic pathogens Mucispirillum and Ruminococcus were reduced by approximately 2.6 and 26 fold, respectively, in ketamine group. Low levels of Lactobacillus and Turicibacter are associated with various disorders including depression and administration of certain species of Lactobacillus ameliorates depressive-like behavior in animal models. Hence, some of the antidepressant effects of ketamine might be mediated through its interaction with these gut bacteria. Additionally, high level of Ruminococcus is positively associated with the severity of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and some species of Mucispirillum have been associated with intestinal inflammation. Indirect evidence of anti-inflammatory role of Sarcina has been documented. Hence, some of the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine and its usefulness in specific inflammatory diseases including IBS may be mediated through its interaction with these latter bacteria. Conclusion: Our data suggest that at least some of the antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects of daily ketamine treatment for 7 days may be mediated via its interaction with specific gut bacteria. These findings further validate the usefulness of microbiome as a target for therapeutic intervention and call for more detailed investigation of microbiome interaction with central mediators of mood and/or inflammatory disorders.},

Researchers and clinicians assume that inflexible everyday behaviors in autism are directly related to cognitive flexibility deficits as assessed by clinical and experimental measures. However, there is a large gap between the day-to-day behavioral flexibility and that measured with these cognitive flexibility tasks. To advance the field, experimental measures must evolve to reflect mechanistic models of flexibility deficits. Moreover, ecologically valid measures are required to be able to resolve the paradox between cognitive and behavioral inflexibility.},

  abstract = {After the discovery of adult neurogenesis (stem cell-driven production of new neuronal elements), it is conceivable to find young, undifferentiated neurons mixed with mature neurons in the neural networks of the adult mammalian brain. This “canonical” neurogenesis is restricted to small stem cell niches persisting from embryonic germinal layers, yet, the genesis of new neurons has also been reported in various parenchymal brain regions. Whichever the process involved, several populations of “young” neurons can be found at different locations of the brain. Across the years, further complexity emerged: (i) molecules of immaturity can also be expressed by non-dividing cells born during embryogenesis, then maintaining immature features later on; (ii) remarkable interspecies differences exist concerning the types, location, amount of undifferentiated neurons; (iii) re-expression of immaturity can occur in aging (dematuration). These twists are introducing a somewhat different definition of neurogenesis than normally assumed, in which our knowledge of the “young” neurons is less sharp. In this emerging complexity, there is a need for complete mapping of the different “types” of young neurons, considering their role in postnatal development, plasticity, functioning, and interspecies differences. Several important aspects are at stake: the possible role(s) that the young neurons may play in maintaining brain efficiency and in prevention/repair of neurological disorders; nonetheless, the correct translation of results obtained from laboratory rodents. Hence, the open question is: how many types of undifferentiated neurons do exist in the brain, and how widespread are they?},

This narrative review constructs a patient-centered perspective on antidepressant use, which examines research on patients' attitudes to antidepressants and their treatment preferences; experiences of being prescribed antidepressants and taking antidepressants, as well as reasons for adherence or nonadherence. Key themes in the research literature suggest that patients have predominantly negative views of antidepressants and that they prefer psychotherapy to medication. Patients may agree to antidepressants because they have limited information about the medication or about other treatment options. Although they may see themselves as active in the decision to take antidepressants, they tend to accept the physicians' recommendation during the initial crisis period during which they seek help. They may also continue taking antidepressants because of experience of withdrawal symptoms and lack of on-going support from their physician. Patients may be acting on rational concerns about an antidepressant when they choose not to comply with its prescription. This review suggests that physicians should be more active in discussing patients' concerns about antidepressants with them.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of spatial memories, and it is thought that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may participate in this form of learning. To better elucidate the relationship between neurogenesis and spatial learning, we examined both across the entire life span of mice. We found that cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and neurogenesis significantly decrease with age, and that there is an abrupt reduction in these processes early on, between 1.5-3 months of age. After this, the neurogenic capacity continues to decline steadily. The initial abrupt decline in adult neurogenesis was paralleled by a significant reduction in Morris Water Maze performance, however overall learning and memory remained constant thereafter. Further analysis of the search strategies employed revealed that reductions in neurogenesis in the aging brain were strongly correlated with the adoption of spatially imprecise search strategies. Overall, performance measures of learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze were maintained at relatively constant levels in aging animals due to an increase in the use of spatially imprecise search strategies.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress can change how we learn and, thus, how we make decisions1–5. Here we investigated the neuronal circuit mechanisms that enable this. Using a multifaceted systems neuroscience approach in male and female mice, we reveal a dual-pathway, amygdala–striatal neuronal circuit architecture by which a recent history of chronic stress disrupts the action–outcome learning underlying adaptive agency and promotes the formation of inflexible habits. We found that the projection from the~basolateral amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum is activated by rewarding events to support the action–outcome learning needed for flexible, goal-directed decision-making. Chronic stress attenuates this to disrupt action–outcome learning and, therefore, agency. Conversely, the projection from the~central amygdala to the dorsomedial striatum mediates habit formation. Following stress, this pathway is progressively recruited to learning to promote the premature formation of inflexible habits. Thus, stress exerts opposing effects on two amygdala–striatal pathways to disrupt agency and promote habit. These data provide neuronal circuit insights into how chronic stress shapes learning and decision-making, and help understanding of how stress can lead to the disrupted decision-making and pathological habits that characterize substance use disorders and mental health conditions.},

A change in the view of psychological and biological processes, from seeing them as separate to complementing one another, has introduced new perspectives on pathological mechanisms of depression and treatment mode of action. This review presents a theoretical model that incorporated this novel approach, the cognitive neuropsychological hypothesis of antidepressant action. This model proposes that antidepressant treatments decrease the negative bias in the processing of emotionally salient information early in the course of antidepressant treatment, which leads to the clinically significant mood improvement later in treatment. The paper discusses the role of negative affective biases in the development of depression and response to antidepressant treatments. It also discusses whether the model can be applied to other antidepressant interventions and its potential translational value, including treatment choice, prediction of response and drug development.},

The baculovirus               Autographa californica               multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus induced nuclear actin polymerization by translocating the host actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex into the nucleus, where it was activated by p78/83, a viral Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)–like protein. Nuclear actin assembly by p78/83 and Arp2/3 complex was essential for viral progeny production. Recompartmentalizing dynamic host actin may represent a conserved mode of pathogenesis and reflect viral manipulation of normal functions of nuclear actin.},

  abstract = {A paradigm shift in neuroscience was the discovery that new neurons are constantly produced in the adult mammalian brain of several species, including Homo sapiens. These new-born cells are formed in some main neurogenic niches, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) at the margin of the lateral ventricle and subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In the DG, neuroblasts derive from SGZ progenitors and migrate to the hippocampal granular layer becoming adult granule cells, which are integrated into functional adult circuits. It has been confirmed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a long-lasting phenomenon in the human brain. The functions of hippocampal new-born cells are not fully established. Experimental studies suggest that they have unique electrophysiological properties, including hyperexcitability, which enable them to regulate adult granule cells. Their specific function depends on the anatomical hippocampal location along the hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis. Dorsal hippocampus plays a more defined role on spatial learning and contextual information, while the ventral hippocampus is more related to emotional behavior, stress resilience and social interaction. Several reports suggest a role for AHN in pattern separation, cognitive flexibility, forgetting and reversal learning. It has been proposed that deficits in AHN might impair normal DG function, including pattern separation and cognitive flexibility, which could play a role on the etiology of affective disorders, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, we review recent scientific evidence suggesting that impairment of AHN may underlie the pathophysiology of affective disorders even in humans and that neurogenesis-inspired therapies may be a promising approach to reduce symptoms of affective disorders in humans.},

  abstract = {The elevated T-maze (ETM) is an animal model of anxiety-like behavior that assesses two different defensive behavioral tasks in the same animal—acquisition of inhibitory avoidance and latency to escape from an open and elevated arm. In rats, cute and chronic treatments with anxiolytic-like drugs impair avoidance acquisition while only chronic administration of panicolytic-like drugs impairs open arm withdrawal. To date, only the acute effects of anxiolytic/anxiogenic or panicolytic/panicogenic drugs have been tested in the mouse ETM and the results have partially corroborated those found in the rat ETM. This study investigated the effects of acute (a single intraperitoneal injection 30min before testing) and chronic (daily i.p. injections for 15 consecutive days) treatment with imipramine or fluoxetine, non-selective and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, respectively, on inhibitory avoidance and escape tasks in the mouse ETM. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with imipramine (0, 1, 5 or 10mg/kg, i.p.) significantly changed the behavioral profile of mice in the two ETM tasks. Interestingly, while acute fluoxetine (0, 5, 10, 20 or 40mg/kg, i.p.) facilitated inhibitory avoidance and impaired escape latency, chronic treatment (0, 5, 20 or 40mg/kg, i.p.) with this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) produced an opposite effect, i.e., it impaired inhibitory avoidance acquisition and facilitated open arm withdrawal. Importantly, acute or chronic treatment with imipramine (except at the highest dose that increased locomotion when given acutely) or fluoxetine failed to alter general locomotor activity in mice as assessed in an ETM in which all arms were enclosed by lateral walls (eETM). These results suggest that inhibitory avoidance acquisition is a useful task for the evaluation of acute and chronic effects of SSRI treatment on anxiety in mice. However, as open arm latency was actually increased and reduced by acute and chronic fluoxetine, respectively, this does not seem to be a useful measure of escape from a proximal threat in this species.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques,  neuroinflammation, and impaired neurogenesis. Urolithin A (UA), a gut-microbial  metabolite of ellagic acid, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects  in the brain. However, it is unknown whether UA exerts its properties of  anti-inflammation and neuronal protection in the APPswe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mouse  model of AD. METHODS: Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive  function. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling  (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry  analyzed the response of glia, Aβ deposition, and neurogenesis. The expression of  inflammatory mediators were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The modulating  effects of UA on cell signaling pathways were assayed by Western blotting.  RESULTS: We demonstrated that UA ameliorated cognitive impairment, prevented  neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, UA  attenuated Aβ deposition and peri-plaque microgliosis and astrocytosis in the  cortex and hippocampus. We also found that UA affected critical cell signaling  pathways, specifically by enhancing cerebral AMPK activation, decreasing the  activation of P65NF-κB and P38MAPK, and suppressing Bace1 and APP degradation.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that UA imparted cognitive protection by  protecting neurons from death and triggering neurogenesis via anti-inflammatory  signaling in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that UA might be a promising therapeutic  drug to treat AD.},

However, only a few studies have used C57BL6/J mice to assess the effects of antidepressant compounds. We carried out a study to compare the behavioural effects of fluoxetine (FLX) in a model of depression in two mice strains: C57BL6/J and BALB/c. We used an 8-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol during which FLX was administered (15\,mg/kg, oral) from the third week to the end of the protocol. We found that UCMS induced degradation of the coat state in the two strains. Moreover, as expected, we observed that FLX elicited antidepressant-like effects in the BALB/c mice by reducing the coat state deterioration and the latency of grooming in splash test. However, in the C57BL6/J mice, it did not induce this action, but instead triggered an opposite effect: an increased sniffing latency in the novelty suppression of feeding test. We conclude that FLX exerts a paradoxical effect in the C57Bl6/J strain. This observation is consistent with some clinical features of hyper-reactivity to FLX observed in humans. Therefore, the UCMS protocol used in C57Bl6/J mice could be a good model to study the mechanisms of the paradoxical effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Cognitive theories of depression posit that people's thoughts, inferences, attitudes, and interpretations, and the way in which they attend to and recall information, can increase their risk for depression. Three mechanisms have been implicated in the relation between biased cognitive processing and the dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and deficits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood states and negative life events, and the inability to use positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this review, we present a contemporary characterization of depressive cognition and discuss how different cognitive processes are related not only to each other, but also to emotion dysregulation, the hallmark feature of depression. We conclude that depression is characterized by increased elaboration of negative information, by difficulties disengaging from negative material, and by deficits in cognitive control when processing negative information. We discuss treatment implications of these conclusions and argue that the study of cognitive aspects of depression must be broadened by investigating neural and genetic factors that are related to cognitive dysfunction in this disorder. Such integrative investigations should help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and biological factors interact to affect the onset, maintenance, and course of depression.

Although synaptic plasticity is key to these processes, its precise spatiotemporal profile remains poorly understood. Using optogenetics to selectively erase long-term potentiation (LTP) within a defined temporal window, we found that distinct phases of synaptic plasticity play differential roles. The first wave acts locally in the hippocampus to confer context specificity. The second wave, during sleep on the same day, organizes these neurons into synchronously firing assemblies. Finally, LTP in the anterior cingulate cortex during sleep on the second day is required for further stabilization of the memory. This demonstrates the precise localization, timing, and characteristic contributions of the plasticity events that underlie the early phase of memory consolidation.},

The current study investigated the effects of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a procedure thought to use moderate stressors, on acquisition of and performance in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Separate behavioral tests were also used to determine whether the stress-induced changes in MWM were due to general changes in locomotor activity or preference for a rewarding stimulus. Adult male rats were exposed to 10 days of different stressors applied at various times. Following the last stressor, stressed and non-stressed rats began training in the MWM, were tested in an open field box, or were tested for sucrose preference. In the MWM, rats exposed to stress had shorter latencies to reach the hidden platform during training. The path lengths on day 2 of training, trials 2 and 4, were shorter in CUS rats compared to controls, with the stressed rats traveling less in the outer portion of the maze. During the probe trial, CUS rats also traveled less overall and less in the outer portion of the maze, although all other measures were the same. The facilitation in learning the platform location was not due to a change in other behavioral components that could contribute to the measures, such as general activity, sensorimotor processing or the preference for a 2\% sucrose solution. Thus, chronic unpredictable stress selectively appears to affect the search strategies in the water maze. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Handling stress is a well-recognised source of variation in animal studies that can also compromise the welfare of research animals. To reduce background variation and maximise welfare, methods that minimise handling stress should be developed and used wherever possible. Recent evidence has shown that handling mice by a familiar tunnel that is present in their home cage can minimise anxiety compared with standard tail handling. As yet, it is unclear whether a tunnel is required in each home cage to improve response to handling. We investigated the influence of prior experience with home tunnels among two common strains of laboratory mice: ICR(CD-1) and C57BL/6. We compared willingness to approach the handler and anxiety in an elevated plus maze test among mice picked up by the tail, by a home cage tunnel or by an external tunnel shared between cages. Willingness to interact with the handler was much greater for mice handled by a tunnel, even when this was unfamiliar, compared to mice picked up by the tail. Once habituated to handling, C57BL/6 mice were most interactive towards a familiar home tunnel, whereas the ICR strain showed strong interaction with all tunnel handling regardless of any experience of a home cage tunnel. Mice handled by a home cage or external tunnel showed less anxiety in an elevated plus maze than those picked up by the tail. This study shows that using a tunnel for routine handling reduces anxiety among mice compared to tail handling regardless of prior familiarity with tunnels. However, as home cage tunnels can further improve response to handling in some mice, we recommend that mice are handled with a tunnel provided in their home cage where possible as a simple practical method to minimise handling stress. © 2013 Gouveia, Hurst.},

  abstract = {Handling laboratory animals during test procedures is an important source of stress that may impair reliability of test responses. Picking up mice by the tail is aversive, stimulating stress and anxiety. Responses among anxious animals can be confounded further by neophobia towards novel test environments and avoidance of test stimuli in open areas. However, handling stress can be reduced substantially by using a handling tunnel, or cupping mice without restraint on the open hand. Here we establish whether non-aversive handling, brief prior familiarisation with the test arena and alternative stimulus placement could significantly improve performance of mice in behavioural tests. We use a simple habituation-dishabituation paradigm in which animals must discriminate between two urine stimuli in successive trials, a task that mice can easily perform. Tail handled mice showed little willingness to explore and investigate test stimuli, leading to poor test performance that was only slightly improved by prior familiarisation. By contrast, those handled by tunnel explored readily and showed robust responses to test stimuli regardless of prior familiarisation or stimulus location, though responses were more variable for cup handling. Our study shows that non-aversive tunnel handling can substantially improve mouse performance in behavioural tests compared to traditional tail handling.},

Picking up mice by the tail is a major source of handling stress that results in strong aversion to the handler, while mice familiarised with being picked up in a tunnel or cupped on the open hand show low stress and anxiety, and actively seek interaction with their handlers. Here we investigate the duration and frequency of handling required for effective familiarisation with these non-aversive handling methods, and test whether this is sufficient to prevent aversion and anxiety when animals then experience immobilisation and a mild procedure (subcutaneous injection). Very brief handling (2 s) was sufficient to familiarise mice with tunnel handling, even when experienced only during cage cleaning. Brief but more frequent handling was needed for familiarisation with cup handling, while pick up by tail induced strong aversion even when handling was brief and infrequent. Experience of repeated immobilisation and subcutaneous injection did not reverse the positive effects of tunnel handling. Our findings demonstrate that replacing tail with tunnel handling during routine cage cleaning and procedures provides a major refinement with little if any cost for familiarisation.},

By analyzing a theoretical model, we show that the switch from excitation to inhibition of the GABAergic input onto maturing newborn cells is crucial for their proper functional integration. When the GABAergic input is excitatory, cooperativity drives the growth of synapses such that newborn cells become sensitive to stimuli similar to those that activate mature cells. When GABAergic input switches to inhibitory, competition pushes the configuration of synapses onto newborn cells toward stimuli that are different from previously stored ones. This enables the maturing newborn cells to code for concepts that are novel, yet similar to familiar ones. Our theory of newborn cell maturation explains both how adult-born dentate granule cells integrate into the preexisting network and why they promote separation of similar but not distinct patterns.},

A series of tests was conducted to assess how physical disturbance, the removal of odour cues and exposure to the odours of strangers experienced during cage cleaning affects aggression within established groups of male CFLP mice, Mus musculus. Handling mice decreased the latency to attack and increased the frequency and duration of aggression within groups. Transferring mice into completely clean cages reduced aggression compared to those replaced in home cages that had not been cleaned. Exposure to the odours of strangers while males were held temporarily in a handling bin had no significant effect on aggression when the males were transferred to clean cages or returned to their home cages. Aggression was greatest when mice were replaced in home cages that had not been cleaned but that had a clean sawdust substrate, and decreased with increasing removal of home cage odours on the cage base and grill. Common cage-cleaning practices in which only the substrate and parts of the cage are cleaned, and other procedures that involve daytime handling and replacing mice in their home cage may thus promote aggression within male groups. Transferring mice into completely clean cages is recommended when aggression within caged groups of males is a concern. © 1995.},

Indeed, escape latency is the main, and often unique, performance measure used for the quantification of behavior. Aim of the present work was to overcome this limitation by presenting a methodology that allows for automatic categorical pattern recognition of the behavioral strategies performed in the MWM. By selecting few a priori and user-defined behavioral categories, many quantitative variables and regions of interest (ROIs), we used discriminant analysis (DA) to obtain 97.9\% of correct automatic recognition of categories. The developed discriminant model (DM) also allowed to predict category membership of newly recorded swim paths with the same statistical efficacy (96\%), and to identify the variables that better discriminate between adjacent categories. The combination of DA with a tracking system, a selection of many variables, different ROIs and qualitative categorization, reduces the gap between the measurement process and the categories used to describe a given behavior, and offers a methodology to computationally reproduce the human categorization of behaviors in the MWM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary restriction (DR) is the most effective environmental intervention to extend lifespan in a wide range of species. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the benefits of DR on longevity are still poorly characterized. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by a decrease in energy levels, raising the possibility that AMPK might mediate lifespan extension by DR. RESULTS: By using a novel DR assay that we developed and validated in C. elegans, we find that AMPK is required for this DR method to extend lifespan and delay age-dependent decline. We find that AMPK exerts its effects in part via the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. FOXO/DAF-16 is necessary for the beneficial effects of this DR method on lifespan. Expression of an active version of AMPK in worms increases stress resistance and extends longevity in a FOXO/DAF-16-dependent manner. Lastly, we find that AMPK activates FOXO/DAF-16-dependent transcription and phosphorylates FOXO/DAF-16 at previously unidentified sites, suggesting a possible direct mechanism of regulation of FOXO/DAF-16 by AMPK. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that an energy-sensing AMPK-FOXO pathway mediates the lifespan extension induced by a novel method of dietary restriction in C. elegans.},

  abstract = {GABAergic inhibition is critical for the precision of neuronal spiking and the homeostatic regulation of network activity in the brain. Adult neurogenesis challenges network homeostasis because new granule cells (GCs) integrate continuously in the functional dentate gyrus. While developing, adult-born GCs undergo a transient state of enhanced excitability due to the delayed maturation of perisomatic GABAergic inhibition by parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs). The mechanisms underlying this delayed synaptic maturation remain unknown. We examined the morphology and function of synapses formed by PV-INs onto new GCs over a 2-month interval in young adult mice, and investigated the influence of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-2 (NL2). Perisomatic appositions of PV-IN terminals onto new GCs were conspicuous at 2 weeks and continued to grow in size to reach a plateau over the fourth week. Postsynaptic knockdown of NL2 by expression of a short-hairpin RNA (shNL2) in new GCs resulted in smaller size of synaptic contacts, reduced area of perisomatic appositions of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, and the number of presynaptic active sites. GCs expressing shNL2 displayed spontaneous GABAergic responses with decreased frequency and amplitude, as well as slower kinetics compared to control GCs. In addition, postsynaptic responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of PV-INs exhibited slow kinetics, increased paired-pulse ratio and coefficient of variation in GCs with NL2 knockdown, suggesting a reduction in the number of active synapses as well as in the probability of neurotransmitter release (Pr). Our results demonstrate that synapses formed by PV-INs on adult-born GCs continue to develop beyond the point of anatomical growth, and require NL2 for the structural and functional maturation that accompanies the conversion into fast GABAergic transmission.},

One hypothesis is that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus enables spatial pattern separation, allowing animals to distinguish between similar stimuli. We investigated whether spatial pattern separation and other putative hippocampal functions of adult neurogenesis were altered in a novel genetic model of neurogenesis ablation in the rat. In rats engineered to express thymidine kinase (TK) from a promoter of the rat glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ganciclovir treatment reduced new neurons by 98\%. GFAP-TK rats showed no significant difference from controls in spatial pattern separation on the radial maze, spatial learning in the water maze, contextual or cued fear conditioning. Meta-analysis of all published studies found no significant effects for ablation of adult neurogenesis on spatial memory, cue conditioning or ethological measures of anxiety. An effect on contextual freezing was significant at a threshold of 5\% (P = 0.04), but not at a threshold corrected for multiple testing. The meta-analysis revealed remarkably high levels of heterogeneity among studies of hippocampal function. The source of this heterogeneity remains unclear and poses a challenge for studies of the function of adult neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {Anxiety can be thought of as a future-oriented emotional state that is characterized by anticipatory cognitive, behavioural and affective changes in response to uncertainty about potential threat. Although it often serves an adaptive role, extreme anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual presence or likelihood of threat can cause distress and suffering for individuals with clinical anxiety disorders.We propose a new model, called the 'uncertainty and anticipation model of anxiety' (UAMA), which emphasizes five processes explaining why uncertainty about future threat is so disruptive in anxiety. These five processes are inflated estimates of threat cost and probability, increased threat attention and hypervigilance, deficient safety learning, behavioural and cognitive avoidance and heightened reactivity to threat uncertainty. The neural circuitry for each of the five UAMA processes promotes an adaptive role in responding to and reducing uncertainty about threat.However, alterations in that neural circuitry result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in pathological anxiety.The key brain regions implicated in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in anxiety include the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula.The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, which is heavily interconnected with each of these brain regions, shows consistent functional and structural abnormalities in clinical anxiety. We propose a central role for this region in contributing to an array of maladaptive responses to uncertainty.In focusing the experimental and theoretical literatures through the common lens of uncertainty, this perspective provides a unifying theme that binds together many diverse features of clinical anxiety and thus provides a conceptual framework for advancing future research on the neurobiology of anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {This manuscript comprehensively reviews the interrelationship between spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Spermatogonial stem cells in the testes of male mammals, characterized by their self-renewal and pluripotential differentiation capabilities, are essential for tissue regeneration, immunomodulation, and advancements in regenerative medicine. This review delves into the historical background and biological characteristics of SSCs, with a particular emphasis on the pivotal role of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in their proliferation, maturation, and differentiation processes. Research indicates that the JAK/STAT pathway extensively influences various functionalities of spermatogonial stem cells, encompassing immunomodulation, tissue differentiation, homing, and adaptation to the microenvironment. Herein, we collate and dissect related studies, shedding light on the intricate dynamics between SSCs and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and examine the implications of these interactions on the biological attributes and functionalities of SSCs. Furthermore, the review discusses the profound implications of these findings for preclinical research and the domain of cellular engineering. It is acknowledged that, despite advancements in the research of SSCs and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, investigations in humans and larger mammals remain inadequate, necessitating more in-depth exploration to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework. Overall, this review offers an invaluable reference for deciphering the mechanisms of the spermatogonial stem cell signaling pathways and establishes a theoretical groundwork for related preclinical research.},

Despite this impending crisis, we are still waiting for improved therapeutic options for this disorder to emerge, which has led to increasing criticism of the role and value of preclinical models of depression. In this Review, we examine this landscape, focusing firstly on issues related to the terminology used in this context and the myriad of preclinical approaches to modelling and assaying aspects of depression in rodents. We discuss the importance of sex as a biological variable and the controversial idea of intergenerational and transgenerational transmission of depressive-like traits. We then examine the technical strategies available to dissect these models and review emerging evidence for putative druggable disease mechanisms. Finally, we propose a brief framework for future research that makes optimal use of these models and will, we hope, accelerate the discovery of improved antidepressants.},

  abstract = {Rigorous evidence identification is essential for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (evidence syntheses) because the sample selection of relevant studies determines a review's outcome, validity, and explanatory power. Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Post-training increases in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories in adult mice. This form of forgetting might be due to increased numbers of new neurons, remodeling of hippocampal circuitry or some combination of both. Here we tested the hypothesis that neurogenesis-mediated forgetting is caused by remodeling of hippocampal circuits by engineering mice in which adult-generated granule cells hypo- or hyper-integrate into hippocampal circuits. Using gene deletion, opto- and chemogenetic strategies, we find that hypo-integration of newborn neurons prevents post- training exercise-induced forgetting of contextual fear memories. Conversely, inducing hyper- integration of newborn neurons following contextual fear conditioning is sufficient to produce forgetting. Because these interventions did not affect survival of newborn neurons, these findings suggest that neurogenesis-mediated remodeling of hippocampal circuits represents a continuous and active form of interference that alters accessibility of engrams underlying hippocampal memories. Consistent with this, using engram-labeling approaches, we found that exercise-induced forgetting was associated with reduced engram reactivation.},

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) supports lung tissue architecture and physiology by providing mechanical stability and elastic recoil. Over the last several decades, it has become increasingly clear that the stiffness of the ECM governs many cellular processes, including cell-phenotype and functions during development, healing, and disease. Of all the lung ECM proteins, collagen-I is the most abundant and provides tensile strength. In many fibrotic lung diseases, the expression of collagen is increased which affects the stiffness of the surrounding environment. The goal of this study was to assess the effect on fibroblast morphology, cell death, and inflammation when exposed to 2D and 3D low (0.4 mg/mL) versus high (2.0 mg/mL) collagen-I-matrix environments that model the mechanics of the breathing lung. This study demonstrates that human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL1), grown in a 3D collagen type-I environment compared to a 2D one, do not form cells with a myofibroblast morphology, express less F-actin stress fibers, exhibit less cell death, and significantly produce less pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines. Exposure to mechanical strain to mimic breathing (0.2 Hz) led to the loss of HFL1 fibroblast dendritic extensions as well as F-actin stress fibers within the cell cytoskeleton, but did not influence cytokine production or cell death. This dynamic assay gives researchers the ability to consider the assessment of the mechanodynamic nature of the lung ECM environment in disease-relevant models and the potential of mechano-pharmacology to identify therapeutic targets for treatment.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity that are widely believed to comprise the physiological correlates of associative learning. They comprise a persistent, input-specific increase or decrease, respectively, in synaptic efficacy that, in rodents, can be followed for days and weeks               in vivo               . Persistent ({$>$}24 h) LTP and LTD exhibit distinct frequency-dependencies and molecular profiles in the hippocampal subfields. Moreover, causal and genetic studies in behaving rodents indicate that both LTP and LTD fulfil specific and complementary roles in the acquisition and retention of spatial memory. LTP is likely to be responsible for the generation of a record of spatial experience, which may serve as an associative schema that can be re-used to expedite or facilitate subsequent learning. In contrast, LTD may enable modification and dynamic updating of this representation, such that detailed spatial content information is included and the schema is rendered unique and distinguishable from other similar representations. Together, LTP and LTD engage in a dynamic interplay that supports the generation of complex associative memories that are resistant to generalization.

  abstract = {Adequate maturation of neurons and their integration into the hippocampal circuit is crucial for normal cognitive function and emotional behavior, and disruption of this process could cause disturbances in mental health. Previous reports have shown that mice heterozygous for a null mutation in α-CaMKII, which encodes a key synaptic plasticity molecule, display abnormal behaviors related to schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. In these mutants, almost all neurons in the dentate gyrus are arrested at a pseudoimmature state at the molecular and electrophysiological levels, a phenomenon defined as “immature dentate gyrus (iDG).” To date, the iDG phenotype and shared behavioral abnormalities (including working memory deficit and hyperlocomotor activity) have been discovered in Schnurri-2 knockout, mutant SNAP-25 knock-in, and forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout mice. In addition, both chronic fluoxetine treatment and pilocarpine-induced seizures reverse the neuronal maturation, resulting in the iDG phenotype in wild-type mice. Importantly, an iDG-like phenomenon was observed in post-mortem analysis of brains from patients with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder. Based on these observations, we proposed that the iDG is a potential endophenotype shared by certain types of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review summarizes recent data describing this phenotype and discusses the data's potential implication in elucidating the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {It is agreed upon that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) in rodents. However, the existence of AHN in humans, particularly in elderly individuals, remains to be determined. Recently, several studies reported that neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature neurons were detected in the hippocampus of elderly humans, based on the expressions of putative markers for these cells, claiming that this provides evidence of the persistence of AHN in humans. Herein, we briefly overview the phenomenon that we call “dematuration,” in which mature neurons dedifferentiate to a pseudo-immature status and re-express the molecular markers of neural progenitor cells and immature neurons. Various conditions can easily induce dematuration, such as inflammation and hyper-excitation of neurons, and therefore, the markers for neural progenitor cells and immature neurons may not necessarily serve as markers for AHN. Thus, the aforementioned studies have not presented definitive evidence for the persistence of hippocampal neurogenesis throughout adult life in humans, and we would like to emphasize that those markers should be used cautiously when presented as evidence for AHN. Increasing AHN has been considered as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, given that immature neuronal markers can be re-expressed in mature adult neurons, independent of AHN, in various disease conditions including AD, strategies to increase the expression of these markers in the DG may be ineffective or may worsen the symptoms of such diseases.},

The tph1 isoform is expressed in peripheral tissues, whereas tph2 is brain and neuron-specific. Recent studies suggest that tph2 expression and brain serotonin turnover are upregulated in depressed suicide patients, and drug-free depressed patients, respectively. Increased tph2 expression could result from genetic influences, early life developmental influences, adverse experience during adulthood, or interactions among these factors. Studies in rodents support the hypothesis that interactions between early life developmental influences and adverse experience during adulthood play an important role in determining tph2 expression. In this review, we highlight the evidence for the effects of adverse early life experience and stressful experience during adulthood on both tph1 and tph2 expression.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects more than 10\% of the population, although our understanding of the underlying aetiology of the disease and how antidepressant drugs act to remediate symptoms is limited. Major obstacles include the lack of availability of good animal models that replicate aspects of the phenotype and tests to assay depression-like behaviour in non-human species. To date, research in rodents has been dominated by two types of assays designed to test for depression-like behaviour: behavioural despair tests, such as the forced swim test, and measures of anhedonia, such as the sucrose preference test. These tests have shown relatively good predictive validity in terms of antidepressant efficacy, but have limited translational validity. Recent developments in clinical research have revealed that cognitive affective biases (CABs) are a key feature of MDD. Through the development of neuropsychological tests to provide objective measures of CAB in humans, we have the opportunity to use 'reverse translation' to develop and evaluate whether similar methods are suitable for research into MDD using animals. The first example of this approach was reported in 2004 where rodents in a putative negative affective state were shown to exhibit pessimistic choices in a judgement bias task. Subsequent work in both judgement bias tests and a novel affective bias task suggest that these types of assay may provide translational methods for studying MDD using animals. This review considers recent work in this area and the pharmacological and translational validity of these new animal models of CABs.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder is a significant and costly cause of global disability. Until the discovery of the rapid acting antidepressant (RAAD) effects of ketamine, treatments were limited to drugs that have delayed clinical benefits. The mechanism of action of ketamine is currently unclear but one hypothesis is that it may involve neuropsychological effects mediated through modulation of affective biases (where cognitive processes such as learning and memory and decision-making are modified by emotional state). Previous work has shown that affective biases in a rodent decision-making task are differentially altered by ketamine, compared to conventional, delayed onset antidepressants. This study sought to further investigate these effects by comparing ketamine with other NMDA antagonists using this decision-making task. We also investigated the subtype selective GluN2B antagonist, CP-101,606 and muscarinic antagonist scopolamine which have both been shown to have RAAD effects. Both CP-101,606 and scopolamine induced similar positive biases in decision-making to ketamine, but the same effects were not seen with other NMDA antagonists. Using targeted medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) infusions, these effects were localised to the mPFC. In contrast, the GABAA agonist, muscimol, induced general disruptions to behaviour. These data suggest that ketamine and other RAADs mediate a specific effect on affective bias which involves the mPFC. Non-ketamine NMDA antagonists lacked efficacy and we also found that temporary inactivation of the mPFC did not fully recapitulate the effects of ketamine, suggesting a specific mechanism.},

However, it is not well understood whether acute fluoxetine influences synaptic plasticity, especially on hippocampal CA1 long-term depression (LTD), and if so, whether it subsequently impacts hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Here, we reported that LTD facilitated by elevated-platform stress in hippocampal slices was completely prevented by fluoxetine administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before stress. The LTD was not, however, significantly inhibited by fluoxetine administration immediately after stress. Similarly, fluoxetine incubation (10 μM) during electrophysiological recordings also displayed no influence on the stress-facilitated LTD. In addition, behavioral results showed that a single fluoxetine treatment 30 min before but not after acute stress fully reversed the impairment of spatial memory retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm. Taken together, these results suggest that acute fluoxetine treatment only before, but not after stress, can prevent hippocampal CA1 LTD and spatial memory retrieval impairment caused by behavioral stress in adult animals.},

  abstract = {Critical network states and neural plasticity are essential for flexible behavior in an ever-changing environment, which allows for efficient information processing and experience-based learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling were considered the key players in enabling memory while stabilizing network dynamics. However, spine-number-based structural plasticity is not consistently reported as a homeostatic mechanism, leading to an insufficient under-standing of its functional impact. Here, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGPF-tagged neurons in organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and computational modeling to study the re-sponse of structural plasticity under activity perturbations and its interplay with homeostatic synaptic scaling. By following individual dendritic segments, we demonstrated that the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission did not linearly regulate dendritic spine density: Inhibition of AMPA receptors with a low concentration of 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX, 200 nM) sig-nificantly increased the spine density while complete blockade of AMPA receptors with 50 µM NBQX reduced spine density. Motivated by these results, we established network simulations in which a biphasic structural plasticity rule governs the activity-dependent formation of synapses. We showed that this bi-phasic rule maintained neural activity homeostasis upon stimulation and permitted both synapse formation and synapse loss, depending on the degree of activity deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling affected the recurrent connectivity, modulated the network activity, and influenced the outcome of structural plasticity. It reduced stimulation-triggered homeostatic synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights; meanwhile, it rescued silencing-induced synapse degeneration by am-plifying recurrent inputs via upscaling to reactivate silent neurons. Their interplay explains divergent results obtained in varied experimental settings. In summary, calcium-based synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity rules compete and compensate one another other to achieve an eco-nomical and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the effects of antidepressant drug treatment on measures of emotional processing. Such actions may help us understand the role of monoamines in emotional dysfunction in depression and how antidepressant drug treatments work. Recent studies suggest that decreasing central serotonin function with tryptophan depletion can reinstate negative biases in recovered depressed patients, even at doses insufficient to induce changes in mood. Conversely, antidepressant drug administration increases the processing of positive emotional information in healthy volunteers and acutely depressed patients early in treatment. This increase in positive bias may provide a platform for subsequent cognitive restructuring and learning which contributes to the evolution of symptom change in depression. Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that these early antidepressant effects involve fronto-limbic and extra-striate circuitry suggestive of actions on both the initial appraisal and attentional processing of affective stimuli. This approach may therefore provide a framework for linking psychological and biological processes in emotional disorders and their treatment. Antidepressants may not directly modulate mood and anxiety but rather allow a different perspective for our ongoing evaluation of our self, the world and the future. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have antidepressant effects in some patients supports the notion that serotonin plays a role in the mode of action of antidepressant drugs. However, neither the way in which serotonin may alleviate depressed mood nor the reason why several weeks needs to elapse before the full antidepressant effect of treatment is expressed is known. Here, we propose a neuropsychological theory of SSRI antidepressant action based on the ability of SSRIs to produce positive biases in the processing of emotional information. Both behavioural and neuroimaging studies show that SSRI administration produces positive biases in attention, appraisal and memory from the earliest stages of treatment, well before the time that clinical improvement in mood becomes apparent. We suggest that the delay in the clinical effect of SSRIs can be explained by the time needed for this positive bias in implicit emotional processing to become apparent at a subjective, conscious level. This process is likely to involve the re-learning of emotional associations in a new, more positive emotional environment. This suggests intriguing links between the effect of SSRIs to promote synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and their ability to remediate negative emotional biases in depressed patients. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Novel approaches to understanding of antidepressant drug action include a focus on early changes in emotional and social processing and the role of neural plasticity. In this Review, we discuss the ways in which these two different theories reflect different or complementary approaches, and how they might be integrated to offer novel solutions for people with depression. We consider the predictions made by these mechanistic approaches for the stratification and development of new therapeutics for depression, and the next steps that need to be made to facilitate this translation of science to the clinic.},

The primary goal of this review is to illustrate how these two pathways may converge at the level of the glia to contribute to neuropsychiatric disease. We propose that a combination of failed clearance and exaggerated release of glutamate by glial cells during immune activation leads to glutamate increases and promotes aberrant extrasynaptic signaling through ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, ultimately resulting in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Furthermore, glutamate diffusion outside the synapse can lead to the loss of synaptic fidelity and specificity of neurotransmission, contributing to circuit dysfunction and behavioral pathology. This review examines the fundamental role of glia in the regulation of glutamate, followed by a description of the impact of inflammation on glial glutamate regulation at the cellular, molecular, and metabolic level. In addition, the role of these effects of inflammation on glia and glutamate in mood disorders will be discussed along with their translational implications.},

Animal models offer the advantages of detailed neurobiological analysis, experimental manipulation of specific components in the brain circuits that underlie psychopathology, and the possibility of screening novel drugs with clinical potential. A large variety of animal models of anxiety and screening tests of anxiolytics is currently in use. While their value in advancing the knowledge and predicting therapeutic success of drugs is unquestionable, the expectations have grown much higher, and the frustration over absence of novel successful drug concepts is rising. It is argued that the multitude of factors that can interfere with animal behaviour in anxiety tests, and the complexity of neurobiology of the various anxiety disorders, present high demands on validation of each anxiety test within each specific laboratory condition. Anxiety models should be explicitly related to a theoretical paradigm on underlying neurobiology, because there is a diversity in concepts, and validation of the model and the selection of behavioural readouts is critically dependent on the neurobiological model. Environmental conditions during the model production and anxiety testing need more attention, including the less considered factors such as ultrasounds. More attention is required to the differences in anxiety neurobiology between males and females, and inter-individual differences in coping strategies.},

Strongyloides ratti delays its expulsion from the gut by induction of regulatory circuits in a mouse strain-specific manner: depletion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) improves the anti-S. ratti immunity in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice. In the current study we compare the hierarchy of immunoregulatory pathways in BALB/c, C57BL/6 mice and their F1 progeny (BALB/c × C57BL/6). Using multicolor flow cytometry, we show that S. ratti induces a distinct pattern of inhibitory checkpoint receptors by Foxp3+ Treg and Foxp3− T cells. Intensity of expression was highest in C57BL/6 and lowest in BALB/c mice, while the F1 cross had an intermediate phenotype or resembled BALB/c mice. Treg subsets expanded during infection in all three mouse strains. Similar to BALB/c mice, depletion of Treg reduced intestinal parasite burden and increased mucosal mast cell activation in S. ratti-infected F1 mice. Our data indicate that Treg dominate the regulation of immune responses in BALB/c and F1 mice, while multiple regulatory layers exist in C57BL/6 mice that may compensate for the absence of Treg.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Approximately one‐third of the patients with MDD are treatment resistant to the current antidepressants. There is also a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. Furthermore, depression in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) is typically poorly responsive to antidepressants. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for rapidly acting antidepressants with beneficial effects in treatment‐resistant patients with MDD or BD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the               N               ‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment‐resistant patients with MDD or BD. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (               R               )‐ketamine (or arketamine) and (               S               )‐ketamine (or esketamine). Because (               S               )‐ketamine has higher affinity for NMDAR than (               R               )‐ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. On 5 March 2019, esketamine nasal spray was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, preclinical data suggest that (               R               )‐ketamine exerts greater potency and longer‐lasting antidepressant effects than (               S               )‐ketamine in animal models of depression and that (               R               )‐ketamine has less detrimental side‐effects than (               R,S               )‐ketamine or (               S               )‐ketamine. In this article, the author reviews the historical overview of the antidepressant actions of enantiomers of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine and hydroxynorketamine. Furthermore, the author discusses the other potential rapid‐acting antidepressant candidates (i.e., NMDAR antagonists and modulators, low‐voltage‐sensitive T‐type calcium channel inhibitor, potassium channel Kir4.1 inhibitor, negative modulators of γ‐aminobutyric acid, and type A [GABA               A               ] receptors) to compare them with ketamine. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine’s antidepressant effects are discussed.},

  abstract = {Ketamine, an anesthetic developed in the early 1960s, is also a popular abused drug among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers, because it produces schizophrenia-like symptoms and dissociation (i.e., out-of-body experience). Regarding mood disorders, ketamine exerts robust antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant patients with depression. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the J\&J (S)-ketamine nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression on March 5, 2019; the spray was then approved in Europe (December 19, 2019). Although (R)-ketamine has lower affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) vs. (S)-ketamine, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like actions in animal models of depression. Importantly, (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side effects than does (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine in rodents, monkeys, and humans. A role for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers has been suggested. A recent RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a role in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. A recent pilot study demonstrated that (R)-ketamine had rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with depression. In this article, the author reviews the mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of the enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites, (S)-norketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and discusses the role of the brain–gut–microbiota axis and brain–spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies investigating the neural basis of episodic memory recall, and the related task of thinking about plausible personal future events, have revealed a consistent network of associated brain regions. Surprisingly little, however, is understood about the contributions individual brain areas make to the overall recollective experience. To examine this, we used a novel fMRI paradigm in which subjects had to imagine fictitious experiences. In contrast to future thinking, this results in experiences that are not explicitly temporal in nature or as reliant on self-processing. By using previously imagined fictitious experiences as a comparison for episodic memories, we identified the neural basis of a key process engaged in common, namely scene construction, involving the generation, maintenance and visualization of complex spatial contexts. This was associated with activations in a distributed network, including hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and retrosplenial cortex. Importantly, we disambiguated these common effects from episodic memory-specific responses in anterior medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. These latter regions may support self-schema and familiarity processes, and contribute to the brain's ability to distinguish real from imaginary memories. We conclude that scene construction constitutes a common process underlying episodic memory and imagination of fictitious experiences, and suggest it may partially account for the similar brain networks implicated in navigation, episodic future thinking, and the default mode. We suggest that additional brain regions are co-opted into this core network in a task-specific manner to support functions such as episodic memory that may have additional requirements.},

  abstract = {The ability to construct a hypothetical situation in one's imagination prior to it actually occurring may afford greater accuracy in predicting its eventual outcome. The recollection of past experiences is also considered to be a reconstructive process with memories recreated from their component parts. Construction, therefore, plays a critical role in allowing us to plan for the future and remember the past. Conceptually, construction can be broken down into a number of constituent processes although little is known about their neural correlates. Moreover, it has been suggested that some of these processes may be shared by a number of other cognitive functions including spatial navigation and imagination. Recently, novel paradigms have been developed that allow for the isolation and characterization of these underlying processes and their associated neuroanatomy. Here, we selectively review this fast-growing literature and consider some implications for remembering the past and predicting the future.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects multilevel models are often used to investigate cross-level interactions, a specific type of context effect that may be understood as an upper-level variable moderating the association between a lower-level predictor and the outcome. We argue that multilevel models involving cross-level interactions should always include random slopes on the lower-level components of those interactions. Failure to do so will usually result in severely anti-conservative statistical inference. We illustrate the problem with extensive Monte Carlo simulations and examine its practical relevance by studying 30 prototypical cross-level interactions with European Social Survey data for 28 countries. In these empirical applications, introducing a random slope term reduces the absolute t-ratio of the cross-level interaction term by 31 per cent or more in three quarters of cases, with an average reduction of 42 per cent. Many practitioners seem to be unaware of these issues. Roughly half of the cross-level interaction estimates published in the European Sociological Review between 2011 and 2016 are based on models that omit the crucial random slope term. Detailed analysis of the associated test statistics suggests that many of the estimates would not reach conventional thresholds for statistical significance in correctly specified models that include the random slope. This raises the question how much robust evidence of cross-level interactions sociology has actually produced over the past decades.},

  abstract = {Handling of laboratory mice is essential for experiments and husbandry, but handling can increase anxiety in mice, compromising their welfare and potentially reducing replicability between studies. The use of non-aversive handling (e.g., tunnel handling or cupping), rather than the standard method of picking mice up by the tail, has been shown to enhance interaction with a handler, reduce anxiety-like behaviours, and increase exploration and performance in standard behavioural tests. Despite this, some labs continue to use tail handling for routine husbandry, and the extent to which non-aversive methods are being used is currently unknown. Here we conducted an international online survey targeting individuals that work with and/or conduct research using laboratory mice. The survey aimed to identify the handling methods currently being used, and to determine common obstacles that may be preventing the wider uptake of non-aversive handling. We also surveyed opinions concerning the current data in support of non-aversive handling for mouse welfare and scientific outcomes. 390 complete responses were received and analysed quantitatively and thematically. We found that 35\% report using tail handling only, and 43\% use a combination of tail and non-aversive methods. 18\% of respondents reported exclusively using non-aversive methods. The vast majority of participants were convinced that non-aversive handling improves animal welfare and scientific outcomes. However, the survey indicated that researchers were significantly less likely to have heard of non-aversive handling and more likely to use tail handling compared with animal care staff. Thematic analysis revealed there were concerns regarding the time required for non-aversive methods compared with tail handling, and that there was a perceived incompatibility of tunnel handling with restraint, health checks and other routine procedures. Respondents also highlighted a need for additional research into the impact of handling method that is representative of experimental protocols and physiological indicators used in the biomedical fields. This survey highlights where targeted research, outreach, training and funding may have the greatest impact on increasing uptake of nonaversive handling methods for laboratory mice.},

  abstract = {Millions of mice are used every year for scientific research, representing the majority of scientific procedures conducted on animals. The standard method used to pick up laboratory mice for general husbandry and experimental procedures is known as tail handling and involves the capture, elevation and restraint of mice via their tails. There is growing evidence that, compared to non-aversive handling methods (i.e. tunnel and cup), tail handling increases behavioural signs of anxiety and induces anhedonia. Hence tail handling has a negative impact on mouse welfare. Here, we investigated whether repeated scruff restraint, intraperitoneal (IP) injections and anaesthesia negated the reduction in anxiety-related behaviour in tunnel compared with tail handled BALB/c mice. We found that mice which experienced repeated restraint spent less time interacting with a handler compared to mice that were handled only. However, after repeated restraint, tunnel handled mice showed increased willingness to interact with a handler, and reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests compared with tail handled mice. The type of procedure experienced (IP injection or anaesthesia), and the duration after which behaviour was measured after a procedure affected the willingness of mice to interact with a handler. Despite this, compared with tail handling, tunnel handling reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests and increased willingness to interact with a handler within hours after procedures. This suggests that the welfare benefits of tunnel handling are widely applicable and not diminished by the use of other putatively more invasive procedures that are frequently used in the laboratory. Therefore, the simple refinement of replacing tail with tunnel handling for routine husbandry and procedures will deliver a substantial improvement for mouse welfare and has the potential for improving scientific outcomes.},

Recent experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests a mechanistic overlap between cardiovascular disease and dementia with a specific focus on the linkage between arterial stiffness, a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, and/or hypertension with Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we investigated whether pharmacological induction of arterial stiffness and hypertension with angiotensin II (1 µg·kg−1·min−1 for 28 days via an osmotic minipump) impairs the progression of Alzheimer’s disease in two mouse models (hAPP23+/− and hAPPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice). Our results show increased arterial stiffness in vivo and hypertension in addition to cardiac hypertrophy after angiotensin II treatment. However, visuospatial learning and memory and pathological cerebral amyloid load in both Alzheimer’s disease mouse models were not further impaired. It is likely that the 28-day treatment period with angiotensin II was too short to observe additional effects on cognition and cerebral pathology.},

More reviews have followed, demonstrating that the dominant and long-held view that withdrawal is mostly mild, affects only a small minority and resolves spontaneously within 1–2 weeks, was at odd with the sparse but growing evidence base. What the scientific literature reveals is in close agreement with the thousands of service user testimonies available online in large forums. It suggests that withdrawal reactions are quite common, that they may last from a few weeks to several months or even longer, and that they are often severe. These findings are now increasingly acknowledged by official professional bodies and societies.},

  abstract = {Recent data indicate that certain pro-inflammatory cytokines are transcriptionally upregulated in the spinal cords of G93A-SOD1 mice, a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously showed that the receptor for tumor necrosis factor ␣ (TNF-R1) was notably elevated at late presymptomatic as well as symptomatic phases of disease (J. Neurochem. 82 (2002) 365). We now extend these findings by showing that message for TNF␣, as well as mRNA for interferon ␥ (IFN␥) and transforming growth factor ␤1/2 (TGF␤1, TGF␤2), is simultaneously increased. Furthermore, TNF␣ protein is significantly increased in G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cords, as are protein levels for interleukin-6 (IL6), IFN␥, and the chemokines RANTES (CCL5) and KC. The interaction of TNF␣, IL6, and IFN␥ proteins was modeled in vitro using Walker EOC-20 murine microglia with nitrite (NO2Ϫ) efflux as a quantitative index of cell response. TNF␣ alone caused robust NO2Ϫ flux, while IL6 had a lesser effect and neither IFN␥ nor IL1␤ was active when applied singly. The TNF␣ stimulus was potently magnified in the presence of IL6 or IFN␥. When applied in combination at very low concentrations, IFN␥ co-synergized with IL6 to produce a multiplicative increase in NO2Ϫ after stimulation with TNF␣. Taken together, these data suggest that modest increases in multiple synergistic cytokines could produce a disproportionately severe activation of microglia within the degenerating spinal cord. Our data support a model wherein TNF␣ acts as a principal driver for neuroinflammation, while several co-stimulating cytokines and chemokines act to potentiate the TNF␣ effects.},

  abstract = {Background Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. They are often discontinued, frequently without the knowledge of the prescribing physician. It is, therefore, important for physicians to be aware of the withdrawal and rebound phenomena that may arise, in order to prevent these phenomena, treat them when necessary, and counsel patients appropriately. Methods This review is based on a comprehensive, structured literature search on antidepressant withdrawal phenomena that we carried out in the CENTRAL, PubMed (Medline), and Embase databases. We classified the relevant publications and reports by their methodological quality. Results Out of a total of 2287 hits, there were 40 controlled trials, 38 cohort studies and retrospective analyses, and 271 case reports that met the inclusion criteria. Withdrawal manifestations are usually mild and self-limiting; common ones include dizziness, headache, sleep disturbances, and mood swings. More serious or prolonged manifestations rarely arise. There is an increased risk with MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, and paroxetine; on the other hand, for agomelatine and fluoxetine, abrupt discontinuation seems to be unproblematic. There is also some evidence of rebound phenomena, i.e., of higher relapse rates or especially severe relapses of depression after the discontinuation of an antidepressant. Conclusion A robust evidence base now indicates that there can be acute withdrawal phenomena when antidepressants are discontinued. Putative rebound phenomena have not been adequately studied to date. It is recommended that antidepressants should be tapered off over a period of more than four weeks.},

  abstract = {Limbic dysfunction and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis dysregulation are key features of affective disorders. The following review summarizes our current understanding of the relationship between limbic structures and control of ACTH and glucocorticoid release, focusing on the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. In general, the hippocampus and anterior cingulate/prelimbic cortex inhibit stress-induced HPA activation, whereas the amygdala and perhaps the infralimbic cortex may enhance glucocorticoid secretion. Several characteristics of limbic-HPA interaction are notable: first, in all cases, the role of given limbic structures is both region- and stimulus-specific. Second, limbic sites have minimal direct projections to HPA effector neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN); hippocampal, cortical and amygdalar efferents apparently relay with neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus and brainstem to access corticotropin releasing hormone neurons. Third, hippocampal, cortical and amygdalar projection pathways show extensive overlap in regions such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus and perhaps brainstem, implying that limbic information may be integrated at subcortical relay sites prior to accessing the PVN. Fourth, these limbic sites also show divergent projections, with the various structures having distinct subcortical targets. Finally, all regions express both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, allowing for glucocorticoid modulation of limbic signaling patterns. Overall, the influence of the limbic system on the HPA axis is likely the end result of the overall patterning of responses to given stimuli and glucocorticoids, with the magnitude of the secretory response determined with respect to the relative contributions of the various structures.},

The hippocampus is a crucial structure for spatial learning and memory, and the addition of new neurons into the DG circuitry of rodents seems to be a key element for these processes to occur. The Morris water maze (MWM) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC) are among the most commonly used hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks to study episodic-like learning and memory in rodents. While the functional contribution of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) through these paradigms has been widely addressed, results have generated controversial findings. In this review, we analyze and discuss possible factors in the experimental methods that could explain the inconsistent results among AHN studies; moreover, we provide specific suggestions for the design of more sensitive protocols to assess AHN-mediated learning and memory functions.},

  abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder classified by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the region of the brain that is responsible for motor control. Surviving neurons in this region contain aggregated protein alpha-Synuclein (αSyn) in the form of cytoplasmic inclusions, referred to as Lewy bodies. Changes in αSyn expression are also associated with PD and its progression. Previously, we demonstrated that signal recognition particle (SRP) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) proteins are involved in protein quality control at the ribosome during translation. We also demonstrated that SRP has an mRNA protection function in addition to a protein targeting function, thus controlling mRNA and protein expression. In this study, we tested involvement of these factors in αSyn biogenesis. We hypothesize that loss of these factors may interfere with αSyn expression, and subsequently, be associated with PD. Using depletion assays in human cell culture and analysis of these proteins in the brains of deceased PD patients, we demonstrate that SRP and AGO2 are involved in the control of αSyn expression and AGO2 has reduced expression in PD. We show for the first time that SRP is involved in mRNA protection of αSyn, a protein that does not have a signal sequence or transmembrane span. Our findings suggest that SRP may interact with a hydrophobic domain in the middle of αSyn during translation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling αSyn biogenesis in cells is vital to developing preventative therapies against PD.},

Another hallucinogenic drug, esketamine, has recently been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved as a rapid-acting antidepressant. The mechanistic basis for the antidepressant effects of psilocybin and ketamine appear to be conserved. The efficacy of these two medications has not, however, been directly compared either clinically or preclinically. Further, whether or not a profound subjective existential experience is necessary for psilocybin to have antidepressant effects is unknown. To address these questions, we tested psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and ketamine in a rat model for depression. As in humans, a single administration of psilocybin or LSD produced persistent antidepressant-like effects in our model. In contrast, ketamine produced only a transient antidepressant-like effect. Our results indicate that classic psychedelics may have therapeutic efficacy that is more persistent than that of ketamine, and also suggest that a subjective existential experience may not be necessary for therapeutic effects.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze test (MWM) is one of the most popular and established behavioral tests to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning ability. The conventional training period is around 5 days, but there is no clear evidence or guidelines about the appropriate duration. In many cases, the final outcome of the MWM seems predicable from previous data and their trend. So, we assumed that if we can predict the final result with high accuracy, the experimental period could be shortened and the burden on testers reduced. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a useful modeling method for datasets that enables us to obtain an accurate mathematical model. Therefore, we constructed an ANN system to estimate the final outcome in MWM from the previously obtained 4 days of data in both normal mice and vascular dementia model mice. Ten-week-old male C57B1/6 mice (wild type, WT) were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (WT-BCAS) or sham-operation (WT-sham). At 6 weeks after surgery, we evaluated their cognitive function with MWM. Mean escape latency was significantly longer in WT-BCAS than in WT-sham. All data were collected and used as training data and test data for the ANN system. We defined a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) as a prediction model using an open source framework for deep learning, Chainer. After a certain number of updates, we compared the predicted values and actual measured values with test data. A significant correlation coefficient was derived form the updated ANN model in both WT-sham and WT-BCAS. Next, we analyzed the predictive capability of human testers with the same datasets. There was no significant difference in the prediction accuracy between human testers and ANN models in both WT-sham and WT-BCAS. In conclusion, deep learning method with ANN could predict the final outcome in MWM from 4 days of data with high predictive accuracy in a vascular dementia model.},

The high psychedelic doses induce perceptual experiences which are associated with therapeutic benefit. There have also been anecdotal reports of these drugs being used at what are colloquially referred to as "micro" doses to improve mood and cognitive function, although currently there are recognized limitations to their clinical and preclinical investigation. In the present studies we have defined a low dose and plasma exposure range in rats for both ketamine (0.3-3 mg/kg [10-73 ng/ml]) and psilocybin/psilocin (0.05-0.1 mg/kg [7-12 ng/ml]), based on studies which identified these as sub-threshold for the induction of behavioral stereotypies. Tests of efficacy were focused on depression-related endophenotypes of anhedonia, amotivation and cognitive dysfunction using low performing male Long Evans rats trained in two food motivated tasks: a progressive ratio (PR) and serial 5-choice (5-CSRT) task. Both acute doses of ketamine (1-3 mg/kg IP) and psilocybin (0.05-0.1 mg/kg SC) pretreatment increased break point for food (PR task), and improved attentional accuracy and a measure of impulsive action (5-CSRT task). In each case, effect size was modest and largely restricted to test subjects characterized as "low performing". Furthermore, both drugs showed a similar pattern of effect across both tests. The present studies provide a framework for the future study of ketamine and psilocybin at low doses and plasma exposures, and help to establish the use of these lower concentrations of serotonergic and dissociative hallucinogens both as a valid scientific construct, and as having a therapeutic utility.},

However, it remains unclear whether expanding the population of adult-born neurons is sufficient to affect anxiety and depression-related behavior. Here, we use an inducible transgenic mouse model in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax is deleted from neural stem cells and their progeny in the adult brain, and thereby increases adult neurogenesis. We find no effects on baseline anxiety and depression-related behavior; however, we find that increasing adult neurogenesis is sufficient to reduce anxiety and depression-related behaviors in mice treated chronically with corticosterone (CORT), a mouse model of stress. Thus, neurogenesis differentially affects behavior under baseline conditions and in a model of chronic stress. Moreover, we find no effect of increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation, either at baseline or following chronic CORT administration, suggesting that increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis can affect anxiety and depression-related behavior through a mechanism independent of the HPA axis. The use of future techniques to specifically inhibit BAX in the hippocampus could be used to augment adult neurogenesis, and may therefore represent a novel strategy to promote antidepressant-like behavioral effects.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic, recurring, and debilitating mental illness that is the most common mood disorder in the United States. It has been almost 50 years since the monoamine hypothesis of depression was articulated, and just over 50 years since the first pharmacological treatment for MDD was discovered. Several monoamine-based pharmacological drug classes have been developed and approved for the treatment of MDD; however, remission rates are low (often less than 60\%) and there is a delayed onset before remission of depressive symptoms is achieved. As a result of a “proof-of-concept” study in 2000 with the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine, a number of studies have examined the glutamatergic systems as viable targets for the treatment of MDD. This review will provide a brief history on the development of clinically available antidepressant drugs, and then review the possible role of glutamatergic systems in the pathophysiology of MDD. Specifically, the glutamatergic review will focus on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the efficacy of drugs that target the NMDA receptor for the treatment of MDD. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which has consistently produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in MDD patients in a number of clinical studies, has shown the most promise as a novel glutamatergic-based treatment for MDD. However, compounds that target other glutamatergic mechanisms, such as GLYX-13 (a glycine-site partial agonist at NMDA receptors) appear promising in early clinical trials. Thus, the clinical findings to date are encouraging and support the continued search for and the development of novel compounds that target glutamatergic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is critical for encoding declarative memory, our repository of knowledge of who, what, where and when. Mnemonic information is processed in the hippocampus through several parallel routes involving distinct subregions. In the classic trisynaptic pathway, information proceeds from entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate gyrus to CA3 and then to CA1, the main hippocampal output. Genetic lesions of EC (ref. 3) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (ref. 4), CA3 (ref. 5) and CA1 (ref. 6) regions have revealed their distinct functions in learning and memory. In contrast, little is known about the role of CA2, a relatively small area interposed between CA3 and CA1 that forms the nexus of a powerful disynaptic circuit linking EC input with CA1 output. Here we report a novel transgenic mouse line that enabled us to selectively examine the synaptic connections and behavioural role of the CA2 region in adult mice. Genetically targeted inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons caused a pronounced loss of social memory--the ability of an animal to remember a conspecific--with no change in sociability or several other hippocampus-dependent behaviours, including spatial and contextual memory. These behavioural and anatomical results thus reveal CA2 as a critical hub of sociocognitive memory processing.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies ascertained positive effects of enriched environments on the well-being of laboratory animals including behavioral, physiological and neurochemical parameters. Conversely, such conclusions imply impaired animal welfare and health in barren husbandry conditions. Moreover, inappropriate housing of laboratory animals may deteriorate the quality of scientific data. Recommendations for housing laboratory animals stipulate that cages should be enriched to mitigate adverse effects of barren housing. In this context, it is not only unclear what exactly is meant by enrichment, but also how the animals themselves interact with the various items on offer. Focal animal observation of female C57BL/6J mice either housed in conventional (CON) or enriched (ENR) conditions served to analyze the impact of enriching housing on welfare related behavior patterns including stereotypical, maintenance, active social, and inactive behaviors. CON conditions resembled current usual housing of laboratory mice, whereas ENR mice received varying enrichment items including foraging, housing and structural elements, and a running disc. Active and inactive use of these elements was quantitatively assessed. CON mice showed significantly more inactive and stereotypical behavior than ENR mice. ENR mice frequently engaged with all enrichment elements, whereby riddles to obtain food reward and the running disc preferably served for active interactions. Offering a second level resulted in high active and inactive interactions. Structural elements fixed at the cagetop were least attractive for the mice. Overall, the presented data underline the positive welfare benefits of enrichment and that mice clearly differentiate between distinct enrichment types, demonstrating that the perspective of the animals themselves should also be taken into account when specifying laboratory housing conditions. This is particularly important, as the ensuring of animal welfare is an essential prerequisite for reliable, reproducible, and scientifically meaningful results.},

  abstract = {Neurogenesis is a mechanism through which antidepressants may produce therapeutic effects. There is a dearth of information regarding the effects of antidepressants on neurogenesis and neurotrophin mobilization in females. This study examined sex differences in the alteration of cell proliferation and survival in multiple regions of the brain. Additional experiments examined brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine to determine whether they mediate sex differences. MRL/MpJ mice were treated with fluoxetine (5 and 10 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 21 days and received injections of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (200 mg/kg) to measure DNA synthesis. In the hippocampus, fluoxetine increased cell proliferation at both doses; females treated with 10 mg/kg produced more new cells than males. Fluoxetine did not alter survival in males, but 10 mg/kg reduced survival in females. In the frontal cortex, fluoxetine increased cell proliferation and survival in males treated with 10 mg/kg. In the cerebellum and amygdala, 10 mg/kg fluoxetine increased cell proliferation in both sexes but did not alter the incorporation of the new cells. Fluoxetine increased BDNF levels in the hippocampus of both sexes. BDNF levels correlated with cell proliferation in males but not females. Brain and plasma levels indicated that females metabolized fluoxetine faster than males and produced more of the metabolite norfluoxetine. These data suggest that fluoxetine acts on multiple areas of the brain to increase cell proliferation, and the pattern of activation differs between males and females. Sex-specific effects of fluoxetine on neurotrophin mobilization and pharmacokinetics may contribute to these differences in neural plasticity.},

The current study examines the relationship between the effects of fluoxetine treatment on behavior, cell proliferation and the neurotrophin BDNF in females. Female MRL/MpJ mice were treated acutely (5 and 10 mg/kg) or chronically (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg b.i.d.) with fluoxetine and tested in the tail suspension test (TST) and or novelty induced hypophagia test (NIH) respectively. Mice treated chronically with fluoxetine received 4 (100 mg/kg) injections of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) on the last 4 days of treatment to measure DNA synthesis. The other half of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex were removed and examined for BDNF levels. Fluoxetine treatment decreased immobility in the TST and latency to eat in the NIH test, but only the highest dose of fluoxetine significantly altered behavior in both tests. Chronic treatment with 5 and 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine significantly increased cell proliferation and BDNF levels in the hippocampus. Only chronic treatment with the highest of fluoxetine increased BDNF levels in the frontal cortex. Behavioral measures in the NIH test correlated with BDNF levels in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus or with cell proliferation in the hippocampus. These data suggest that females require high doses of fluoxetine for behavioral efficacy regardless of elevations of neurogenesis and BDNF mobilization in the hippocampus. Elevations in BDNF levels in the frontal cortex are related to the behavioral efficacy of fluoxetine.},

  abstract = {Antidepressant doses of ketamine rapidly facilitate synaptic plasticity and modify neuronal function within prefrontal and hippocampal circuits. However, most studies have demonstrated these effects in animal models and translational studies in humans are scarce. A recent animal study showed that ketamine restored dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 region within 1 h of administration. To translate these results to humans, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study assessed ketamine’s rapid neuroplastic effects on hippocampal subfield measurements in healthy volunteers. S-Ketamine vs. placebo data were analyzed, and data were also grouped by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype. Linear mixed models showed that overall hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly larger (p = 0.009) post ketamine than post placebo (LS means difference=0.008, standard error=0.003). Post-hoc tests did not attribute effects to specific subfields (all p {$>$} 0.05). Trend-wise volumetric increases were observed within the left hippocampal CA1 region (p = 0.076), and trend-wise volumetric reductions were obtained in the right hippocampal—amygdaloid transition region (HATA) (p = 0.067). Neither genotype nor a genotype–drug interaction significantly affected the results (all p {$>$} 0.7). The study provides evidence that ketamine has short-term effects on hippocampal subfield volumes in humans. The results translate previous findings from animal models of depression showing that ketamine has pro-neuroplastic effects on hippocampal structures and underscore the importance of the hippocampus as a key region in ketamine’s mechanism of action.},

  abstract = {We previously reported that chronic, but not subchronic, treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine altered behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) in BALB/cJ mice. We now use this model to investigate mechanisms underlying the delayed onset of the behavioral response to antidepressants, specifically (1) adult hippocampal neurogenesis and (2) expression of the 5-HT1A receptor. Here, we show data validating this model of chronic antidepressant action. We found the FST to be selectively responsive to chronic administration of the SSRI fluoxetine (18\,mg/kg/day) and the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (20\,mg/kg/day), but not to the antipsychotic haloperidol (1\,mg/kg/day) in BALB/cJ mice. The behavioral effects of fluoxetine emerged by 12 days of treatment, and were affected neither by ablation of progenitor cells of the hippocampus nor by genetic deletion of the 5-HT1A receptor. The effect of fluoxetine in the BALB/cJ mice was also neurogenesis-independent in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. We also found that chronic fluoxetine does not induce an increase in cell proliferation or the number of young neurons as measured by BrdU and doublecortin immunolabeling, respectively, in BALB/cJ mice. These data are in contrast to our previous report using a different strain of mice (129SvEvTac). In conclusion, we find that BALB/cJ mice show a robust response to chronic SSRI treatment in the FST, which is not mediated by an increase in new neurons in the hippocampus, and does not require the 5-HT1A receptor. These findings suggest that SSRIs can produce antidepressant-like effects via distinct mechanisms in different mouse strains.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The issue of unblinded outcome-assessors and patients has repeatedly been stressed as a flaw in allegedly double-blind antidepressant trials. Unblinding bias can for example result from a drug‘s marked side effects. If such unblinding bias is present for a given drug, then it might be expected that the placebos of that drug are rated significantly less effective than that of other antidepressants.                                         Methods                                To test this hypothesis, the present exploratory analysis conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy of 19 different placebos in placebo-controlled trials provided in the dataset by Cipriani et al. (Lancet 2018; 391: 1357–66). Primary outcome was efficacy (continuous) estimated on the standardized mean difference (SMD) scale and defined as the pre-post change~on the Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD-17), on which information was available in                 N                 ~=\,258 trials.                                                        Results                                Comparative placebo ranking suggested mirtazapine-placebo (SMD -2.0 [−\,5.0–1.0 95\% CrI]) to be the most, and amitriptyline- (SMD 1.2 [−\,1.6–3.9 95\% CrI]) and trazodone- (SMD 2.1 [−\,0.9–5.2 95\% CrI]) placebos to be the least effective placebos. Other placebos suggested to be more effective than amitriptyline- and trazodone-placebos (based on 95\% CrIs excluding zero) were citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine placebos. These NMA results were corroborated by the observation that the relative efficacy between drug and placebo was considerably larger for amitriptyline and trazodone than for instance mirtazapine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine, supported by a small and insignificant correlation between drug-efficacy and placebo-efficacy (r\,=\,−\,0.202,                 p                 ~=\,0.408).                                                        Discussion               The present exploratory NMA indicates that distinguishable side effects of older drugs may unblind outcome-assessors thus resulting in overestimation of the average drug-placebo difference and underrating bias in placebo-arms, particularly for the older antidepressant drugs amitriptyline and trazodone. If confirmed in prospective studies, these findings suggest that efficacy rankings for antidepressants are susceptible to bias and should be considered unreliable or misleading. The analysis is limited by the focus on the single-comparison placebos (76\%, i.e., placebos assessed in two-arm trials), since double-comparison placebos (25\%, i.e., placebos assessed in three-arm trials) are hard to interpret and therefore not included in the present interpretation. Another limitation is the problem of multiplicity, which was only approximately accounted for in the Bayesian NMA by modelling treatment effects as exchangeable.},

  abstract = {The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine produces episodic memory deficits. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the effects of ketamine on frontal and hippocampal responses to memory encoding and retrieval in healthy volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subjects comparison of two doses of intravenous ketamine. Dissociation of the effects of ketamine on encoding and retrieval processes was achieved using two study-test cycles: in the first, items were encoded prior to drug infusion and retrieval tested, during scanning, on drug; in the second, encoding was scanned on drug, and retrieval tested once ketamine plasma levels had declined. We additionally determined the interaction of ketamine with the depth of processing that occurred at encoding. A number of effects upon task-dependent activations were seen. Overall, our results suggest that left frontal activation is augmented by ketamine when elaborative semantic processing is required at encoding. In addition, successful encoding on ketamine is supplemented by additional non-verbal processing that is incidental to task demands. The effects of ketamine at retrieval are consistent with impaired access to accompanying contextual features of studied items. Our findings show that, even when overt behaviour is unimpaired, ketamine has an impact upon the recruitment of key regions in episodic memory task performance. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

  abstract = {All individuals experience stressful life events, and up to 84\% of the general population will experience at least one potentially traumatic event. In some cases, acute or chronic stressors lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other psychopathology; however, the majority of people are resilient to such effects. Resilience is the ability to adapt successfully in the face of stress and adversity. A wealth of research has begun to identify the genetic, epigenetic, neural, and environmental underpinnings of resilience, and has indicated that resilience is mediated by adaptive changes encompassing several environmental factors, neural circuits, numerous neurotransmitters, and molecular pathways. The first part of this review focuses on recent findings regarding the genetic, epigenetic, developmental, psychosocial, and neurochemical factors as well as neural circuits and molecular pathways that underlie the development of resilience. Emerging and exciting areas of research and novel methodological approaches, including genome-wide gene expression studies, immune, endocannabinoid, oxytocin, and glutamatergic systems, are explored to help delineate innovative mechanisms that may contribute to resilience. The second part reviews several interventions and preventative approaches designed to enhance resilience in both developmental and adult populations. Specifically, the review will delineate approaches aimed to bolster resilience in individuals with PTSD. Furthermore, we discuss novel pharmacologic approaches, including the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ketamine and neuropeptide Y (NPY), as exciting new prospects for not only the treatment of PTSD but as new targets to enhance resilience. Our growing understanding of resilience and interventions will hopefully lead to the development of new strategies for not just treating PTSD but also screening and early identification of at-risk youth and adults. Taken together, efforts aimed at dissemination and implementation of novel interventions to enhance resilience will have to keep pace with the growth of new preventive and treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The United States is entering its fourth decade of the opioid epidemic with no clear end in sight. At the center of the epidemic is an increase in opioid use disorder (OUD), a complex condition encompassing physical addiction, psychological comorbidities, and socioeconomic and legal travails associated with the misuse and abuse of opioids. Existing behavioral and medication-assisted therapies show limited efficacy as they are hampered by lack of access, strict regimens, and failure to fully address the non-pharmacological aspects of the disease. A growing body of research has indicated the potential of hallucinogens to efficaciously and expeditiously treat addictions, including OUD, by a novel combination of pharmacology, neuroplasticity, and psychological mechanisms. Nonetheless, research into these compounds has been hindered due to legal, social, and safety concerns. This review will examine the preclinical and clinical evidence that psychoplastogens, such as ibogaine, ketamine, and classic psychedelics, may offer a unique, holistic alternative for the treatment of OUD while acknowledging that further research is needed to establish long-term efficacy along with proper safety and ethical guidelines.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The raphe nuclei are distributed near the midline of the brainstem along its entire rostro-caudal extension. The serotonergic neurons are their main neuronal components, although a proportion of them lie in subdivisions of the lateral reticular formation. They develop from mesopontine and medullary primordia, and the resulting grouping into rostral and caudal clusters is maintained into adulthood, and is reflected in the connectivity. Thus, the mesencephalon and rostral pons, neurons within the rostral raphe complex (caudal linear, dorsal raphe, and median raphe nuclei) project primarily to the forebrain. By contrast, in the caudal pons and medulla oblongata, neurons within the caudal raphe complex (raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus nuclei and parts of the adjacent lateral reticular formation) project to the brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord. The median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei provide parallel and overlapping projections to many forebrain structures with axon fibers exhibiting distinct structural and functional characteristics. The caudal group of the serotonergic system projects to the brainstem, and, by three parallel projections, to the dorsal, intermediate and ventral columns in the spinal cord. The serotonergic axons arborize over large areas comprising functionally diverse targets. Some projections form classical chemical synapses while many do not, thus contributing to the so-called paracrine or volume transmission. The serotonergic projections participate in the regulation of different functional (motor, somatosensory, limbic) systems; and have been associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Finally, recent experimental data support the role of serotonin in modulating brain development, such that a dysfunction in serotonergic transmission during early life could lead to long lasting structural and functional alterations.},

  abstract = {There has been growing recognition that major depressive disorder is a serious medical disorder that also affects children. This has been accompanied by an increased use of antidepressant drugs in adolescents; however, not all classes of antidepressants are effective in children and adolescents. There is an increasing need to understand the differences in antidepressant action in different developmental stages. There are some data indicating that the behavioral effect of chronic antidepressant treatment in adult rodents is dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis; however, it is not known which classes of antidepressant drugs induce hippocampal neurogenesis in adolescent rodents. Three classes of antidepressant drugs were tested in two age groups of Sprague Dawley rats, pre-adolescent (postnatal days 11–24) and adolescent (postnatal days 21–34): monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). To address which classes of antidepressant drugs might alter the rate of mitogenesis in neural progenitor cells in an adolescent rodent model, adolescent Sprague Dawley rats were treated with the thymidine analog 5-bromo-deoxy-2′-uridine (BrdU) on postnatal days 21 and 22 and antidepressant drugs or vehicle for 14 days (postnatal days 21–34). To address which classes of antidepressant drugs might alter the rate of neurogenesis, postnatal day-21 Sprague Dawley rats were treated with antidepressant drugs or vehicle for 14 days (postnatal days 21–34) and BrdU on postnatal days 33 and 34. In both experimental paradigms, BrdU-positive cells in the subgranular zone and the granule cell layer were counted. Newborn neurons were identified in the neurogenic paradigm by identifying cells expressing both the neuronal specific marker NeuN and BrdU using confocal microscopy. Only the SSRI fluoxetine significantly altered the basal mitogenic and neurogenic rates in adolescent rats. Treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine (TCP) and the TCA desipramine did not alter the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adolescent rats. This is consistent with human clinical observations, where only SSRIs have efficacy for treatment of depression in patients under the age of 18. In pre-adolescent rats, postnatal days 11–24, none of the drugs tested significantly altered the basal mitogenic or neurogenic rates. All of the classes of antidepressant drugs are known to induce hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. The mechanisms of action underlying this developmental difference in antidepressant drug action between juveniles and adults are not known.},

(Orchidaceae), is listed as a top-grade herbal medicine in Shen-nong Ben-ts'ao  Jing and has been used for treating headaches, dizziness, vertigo and convulsion.  It has a neuroprotective effect and extends the lifespan in mouse models of  Huntington's disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease. However, its effect on  senescence remains unknown. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the  anti-aging effects and the underlying mechanism of Gastrodiae Rhizoma. METHODS:  D-galactose (D-gal)- and BeSO(4)-induced cellular senescence and  senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity were evaluated in  SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells. D-gal-induced aging mice were used as an in vivo model.  Animal behaviors including nesting and burrowing and Morris water maze were  conducted. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus was assessed by immunohistochemistry  and confocal microscopy, and the aging-related proteins were assessed by Western  blot analysis. The potential neuritogenesis activity of the partially purified  fraction of Gastrodiae Rhizoma (TM-2) and its major ingredients were investigated  in PC12 cells. RESULTS: TM-2 could improve D-gal-induced learning and memory  impairement by inhibiting oxidative stress, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis  and regulating the SH2B1-Akt pathway. Moreover, N(6)-(4-hydroxybenzyl)adenine  riboside (T1-11) and parishins A and B, three constituents of TM-2, had  anti-aging activity, as did T1-11 and parishin A induced neuritogenesis.  CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that TM-2 slowed down D-gal-induced cellular and  mouse brain aging. These results indicate that Gastrodiae Rhizoma has a  beneficial effect on senescence. It may be used for neuroprotection and promoting  neurogenesis.},

Our objective was to provide an update on the validity and reliability of the chronic unpredictable mild stress model, by analyzing the interrelationships among the indexes using stepwise discriminant analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the possible combinations. We evaluated the depressive rats in both the presence and the absence of chronic unpredictable mild stress, using weight change, percentage of sucrose preference, coat state, splash test, open-field test, elevated plus-maze test, forced swimming test, and Morris water maze test. The results showed that 6-week-long chronic unpredictable mild stress produces significant depression and anxiety-like behavior. The combination of body weight change, percentage of sucrose preference, coat state score, open-field score, grooming latency of splash test, immobility time in force swimming test, and platform crossing in the Morris water maze test can effectively discriminate between normal and chronic unpredictable mild stress rats. Strong interrelationships were noted among these indexes in both open-field test and elevated plusmaze test. In conclusion, there might be certain criteria for the combination of behavioral endpoints, which is advantageous to more effectively and reliably assess the chronic unpredictable mild stress induced depression model.},

Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, anatomical tracing, and spatial correlation analysis to map the transcriptional and spatial profiles of cells from the mouse DRN. Our analysis of 39,411 single-cell transcriptomes revealed at least 18 distinct neuron subtypes and 5 serotonergic neuron subtypes with distinct molecular and anatomical properties, including a serotonergic neuron subtype that preferentially innervates the basal ganglia. Our study lays out the molecular organization of distinct serotonergic and non-serotonergic subsystems, and will facilitate the design of strategies for further dissection of the DRN and its diverse functions.},

  abstract = {Ketamine has been reported to cause neonatal neurotoxicity via a neuronal apoptosis mechanism; however, no in vivo research has reported whether ketamine could affect postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). A growing number of experiments suggest that postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis is the foundation of maintaining normal hippocampus function into adulthood. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of ketamine on hippocampal neurogenesis. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into two groups: the control group (equal volume of normal saline), and the ketamine-anesthesia group (40 mg/kg ketamine in four injections at 1 h intervals). The S-phase marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered after ketamine exposure to postnatal day 7 (PND-7) rats, and the neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG was assessed using single- or double-immunofluorescence staining. The expression of GFAP in the hippocampal DG was measured by western blot analysis. Spatial reference memory was tested by Morris water maze at 2 months after PND-7 rats exposed to ketamine treatment. The present results showed that neonatal ketamine exposure significantly inhibited neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, decreased astrocytic differentiation, and markedly enhanced neuronal differentiation. The disruptive effect of ketamine on the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs lasted at least 1 week and disappeared by 2 weeks after ketamine exposure. Moreover, the migration of newborn neurons in the granule cell layer and the growth of astrocytes in the hippocampal DG were inhibited by ketamine on PND-37 and PND-44. Finally, ketamine caused a deficit in hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory tasks at 2 months old. Our results suggested that ketamine may interfere with hippocampal neurogenesis and long-term neurocognitive function in PND-7 rats. These findings may provide a new perspective to explain the adult neurocognitive dysfunction induced by neonatal ketamine exposure.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota via the gut-brain axis play a role in the pathogenesis of depression, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. Here we investigated the role of gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model of depression. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increased immobility time in forced swimming test (FST), which was associated with the improvements in α-diversity, consisting of Shannon, Simpson and Chao 1 indices. In addition to α-diversity, β-diversity, such as principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe), showed a differential profile after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, a total of 30 bacteria were significantly altered in the LPS + saline treated mice and LPS + ketamine treated mice. Interestingly, two bacteria, including the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were significantly correlated with the immobility time of FST. Importantly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were potential biomarker for the antidepressant effects of ketamine in an inflammation model. These findings suggest that antidepressant effects of ketamine might be related to the regulation of abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia might be potential biomarkers for ketamine's antidepressant efficacy.},

  abstract = {Control variables are included in regression analyses to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. In this paper, we argue that the estimated effect sizes of controls are unlikely to have a causal interpretation themselves, though. This is because even valid controls are possibly endogenous and represent a combination of several different causal mechanisms operating jointly on the outcome, which is hard to interpret theoretically. Therefore, we recommend refraining from interpreting marginal effects of controls and focusing on the main variables of interest, for which a plausible identification argument can be established. To prevent erroneous managerial or policy implications, coefficients of control variables should be clearly marked as not having a causal interpretation or omitted from regression tables altogether. Moreover, we advise against using control variable estimates for subsequent theory building and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Cognitive flexibility is the ability to switch between different rules or concepts and behavioral flexibility is the overt physical manifestation of these shifts. Behavioral flexibility is essential for adaptive responses and commonly measured by reversal learning and set-shifting performance in rodents. Both tasks have demonstrated vulnerability to stress with effects dependent upon stressor type and number of repetitions. This review compares the effects of stress on reversal learning and set-shifting to provide insight into the differential effect of stress on cognition. Acute and short-term repetition of stress appears to facilitate reversal learning whereas the longer term repetition of stress impairs reversal learning. Stress facilitated intradimensional set-shifting within a single, short-term stress protocol but otherwise generally impaired set-shifting performance in acute and repeated stress paradigms. Chronic unpredictable stress impairs reversal learning and set-shifting whereas repeated cold intermittent stress selectively impairs reversal learning and has no effect on set-shifting. In considering the mechanisms underlying the effects of stress on behavioral flexibility, pharmacological manipulations performed in conjunction with stress are also reviewed. Blocking corticosterone receptors does not affect the facilitation of reversal learning following acute stress but the prevention of corticosterone synthesis rescues repeated stress-induced set-shifting impairment. Enhancing post-synaptic norepinephrine function, serotonin availability, and dopamine receptor activation rescues and/or prevents behavioral flexibility performance following stress. While this review highlights a lack of a standardization of stress paradigms, some consistent effects are apparent. Future studies are necessary to specify the mechanisms underlying the stress-induced impairments of behavioral flexibility, which will aid in alleviating these symptoms in patients with some psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Despite growing evidences of an association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and antidepressant effects, the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression is challenged by the paucity of direct links between BDNF deficit and depressive-like behaviors. The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm might take our understanding a step further by examining whether a decrease in bdnf expression can lead to enhanced vulnerability to stress and prevent antidepressant efficacy in all or specific UCMS-induced alterations. Wild-type bdnf+/+ and heterozygous bdnf+/- mice were exposed to an 8-week UCMS regimen and, from the third week onward, treated with either vehicle or imipramine (20 mg/kg/day, ip). Physical, behavioral and biological (plasma corticosterone levels, bdnf expression in the dentate gyrus) measures were further analyzed regarding to the genotype and the treatment. Heterozygous bdnf+/- mice displayed hyperactivity and increase of body weight but no enhancement of the sensitivity to stress exposure in all the measures investigated here. In contrast, while imipramine treatment reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the novelty-suppressed feeding test in both genotypes, it decreased aggressiveness in the resident/intruder test and immobility in the tail suspension test in wild-type but not in heterozygous mice. Furthermore, imipramine induced a twofold increase of bdnf expression in the dentate gyrus in both genotypes, while bdnf+/- mice displayed roughly half-reduced level for the same treatment. In summary, we demonstrate here that depletion in BDNF dampened the antidepressant effects in several behaviors but failed to increase vulnerability to chronic stress exposure. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has become the most debated topic among scholars and is also being used by many users from different fields. Many articles, reviews, blogs, and opinion essays have been published in which the potential role of ChatGPT as a writing assistant is discussed. For this systematic review, 550 articles published six months after ChatGPT’s release (December 2022 to May 2023) were collected based on specific keywords, and the final 30 most relevant articles were finalized through PRISMA flowchart. The analyzed literature identifies different opinions and scenarios associated with using ChatGPT as a writing assistant and how to interact with it. Findings show that artificial intelligence (AI) in education is a part of the ongoing development process, and its latest chatbot, ChatGPT is a part of it. Therefore, the education process, particularly academic writing, has both opportunities and challenges in adopting ChatGPT as a writing assistant. The need is to understand its role as an aid and facilitator for both the learners and instructors, as chatbots are relatively beneficial devices to facilitate, create ease and support the academic process. However, academia should revisit and update students’ and teachers’ training, policies, and assessment ways in writing courses for academic integrity and originality, like plagiarism issues, AI-generated assignments, online/home-based exams, and auto-correction challenges.},

These changes are often interrelated and can lead to: (vi) system-wide modifications of brain structure as well as to (vii) acquisition of specific functions such as ocular dominance or language. Myelination appears to be plastic both in development and adulthood, at least, in rodents. Adult neuroplasticity is limited, and is mainly expressed as changes in the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses while the attempts to regenerate connections have met with limited success.

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants, in particular newer agents, are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide with annual sales of billions of dollars. The introduction of these agents in the market has passed through seemingly strict regulatory control. Over a thousand randomized trials have been conducted with antidepressants. Statistically significant benefits have been repeatedly demonstrated and the medical literature is flooded with several hundreds of "positive" trials (both pre-approval and post-approval). However, two recent meta-analyses question this picture. The first meta-analysis used data that were submitted to FDA for the approval of 12 antidepressant drugs. While only half of these trials had formally significant effectiveness, published reports almost ubiquitously claimed significant results. "Negative" trials were either left unpublished or were distorted to present "positive" results. The average benefit of these drugs based on the FDA data was of small magnitude, while the published literature suggested larger benefits. A second meta-analysis using also FDA-submitted data examined the relationship between treatment effect and baseline severity of depression. Drug-placebo differences increased with increasing baseline severity and the difference became large enough to be clinically important only in the very small minority of patient populations with severe major depression. In severe major depression, antidepressants did not become more effective, simply placebo lost effectiveness. These data suggest that antidepressants may be less effective than their wide marketing suggests. Short-term benefits are small and long-term balance of benefits and harms is understudied. I discuss how the use of many small randomized trials with clinically non-relevant outcomes, improper interpretation of statistical significance, manipulated study design, biased selection of study populations, short follow-up, and selective and distorted reporting of results has built and nourished a seemingly evidence-based myth on antidepressant effectiveness and how higher evidence standards, with very large long-term trials and careful prospective meta-analyses of individual-level data may reach closer to the truth and clinically useful evidence.},

Subanesthetic doses of ketamine - a glutamatergic modulator - have shown great promise for rapidly treating patients with the most severe forms of depression. As such, ketamine represents a promising probe for understanding the pathophysiology of depression and treatment response. Through neuroimaging, ketamine's mechanism may be elucidated in humans. Here, we review 47 articles of ketamine's effects as revealed by neuroimaging studies. Some important brain areas emerge, especially the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, ketamine may decrease the ability to self-monitor, may increase emotional blunting, and may increase activity in reward processing. Further studies are needed, however, to elucidate ketamine's mechanism of antidepressant action.},

Semi-structured interviews with 20 faculty members of a private university in Pakistan were conducted. The interview responses indicate that university faculty are generally cautious in using ChatGPT. The faculty members had a negative perception and attitude toward using ChatGPT. Potential risks such as cheating and plagiarism were cited as major concerns, while benefits such as ease in lesson planning and assessment were also noted. The results of this study suggest that university faculty need more information and education about ChatGPT to make informed decisions about its use.

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease. Unfortunately, treatment with antidepressants (ADs) has limited therapeutic efficacy since resistance to AD is common. Research in this field is hampered by the lack of a reliable natural animal model of AD resistance. Depression resistance is related to various factors, including the attendance of cardiovascular risk factors and past depressive episodes. We aimed to design a rodent model of depression resistance to ADs, associating cardiovascular risk factors with repeated unpredicted chronic mild stress (UCMS). Male BALB/c mice were given either a regular (4\% fat) or a high fat diet (45\% fat) and subjected to two 7-week periods of UCMS separated by 6 weeks. From the second week of each UCMS procedure, vehicle or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated daily. The effects of the UCMS and fluoxetine in both diet conditions were assessed using physical (coat state and body weight) and behavioural tests (the reward maze test and the splash test). The results demonstrate that during the second procedure, UCMS induced behavioural changes, including coat state degradation, disturbances in self-care behaviour (splash test) and anhedonia (reward maze test) and these were reversed by fluoxetine in the regular diet condition. In contrast, the high-fat diet regimen prevented the AD fluoxetine from abolishing the UCMS-induced changes. In conclusion, by associating UCMS—an already validated animal model of depression—with high-fat diet regimen, we designed a naturalistic animal model of AD resistance related to a sub-nosographic clinical entity of depression.},

  abstract = {There is considerable, although not entirely consistent, evidence that the hippocampus inhibits most aspects of HPA activity, including basal (circadian nadir) and circadian peak secretion as well as the onset and termination of responses to stress. Although much of the evidence for these effects rests only on the measurement of corticosteroids, recent lesion and implant studies indicate that the hippocampus regulates adrenocortical activity at the hypothalamic level, via the expression and secretion of ACTH secretagogues. Such inhibition results largely from the mediation of corticosteroid feedback, although more work is required to determine whether the hippocampus supplies a tonic inhibitory input in the absence of corticosteroids. It must be noted that the hippocampus is not the only feedback site in the adrenocortical system, since removal of its input only reduces, but does not abolish, the efficacy of corticosteroid inhibition, and since other elements of the axis appear eventually to compensate for deficits in feedback regulation. The importance of other feedback sites is further suggested not only by the presence of corticosteroid receptors in other parts of the brain and pituitary, but also by the improved prediction of CRF levels by combined hypothalamic and hippocampal receptor occupancy. The likelihood of feedback mediated by nonhippocampal sites underscores the need for future work to characterize hippocampal influence on HPA activity in the absence of changes in corticosteroid secretion. However, despite the fact that the hippocampus is not the only feedback site, it is distinguished from most potential feedback sites, including the hypothalamus and pituitary, by its high content of both type I and II corticosteroid receptors. The hippocampus is therefore capable of mediating inhibition over a wide range of steroid levels. The low end of this range is represented by corticosteroid inhibition of basal (circadian nadir) HPA activity. The apparent type I receptor specificity of this inhibition and the elevation of trough corticosteroid levels after hippocampal damage support a role for hippocampal type I receptors in regulating basal HPA activity. It is possible that basal activity is controlled in part through hippocampal inhibition of vasopressin, since the inhibition of portal blood vasopressin correlates with lower levels of hippocampal receptor occupancy, and the expression of vasopressin by some CRF neurons is sensitive to very low corticosteroid levels. At the high end of the physiological range, stress-induced or circadian peak corticosteroid secretion correlates strongly with occupancy of the lower affinity hippocampal type II receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Depending on the cognitive test, this may be the time it takes an animal to escape to a hidden platform (water maze), an escape tunnel (Barnes maze) or to enter a dark component (passive avoidance test). Latency outcomes are usually statistically analyzed using ANOVAs. Besides strong distributional assumptions, ANOVA cannot properly deal with animals not showing the performance measure within the trial time, potentially causing biased and misleading results. We propose an alternative approach for statistical analyses of latency outcomes. These analyses have less distributional assumptions and adequately handle results of trials in which the performance measure did not occur within the trial time. The proposed method is well known from survival analyses, provides comprehensible statistical results and allows the generation of meaningful graphs. Experiments of behavioral neuroscience and anesthesiology are used to illustrate this method.},

  abstract = {Judgment bias tests have become an important tool in the assessment of animals’ affective states. Subjects are first trained to discriminate between two cues associated with a positive and a less-positive outcome. After successful training, they are confronted with an ambiguous cue, and responses are used for judgment bias assessment. In spatial settings, ambiguous cue presentation is typically linked with novelty, i.e. to yet unexplored areas or areas to which the animal has a low degree of habituation. We hypothesized that in such settings, responses to ambiguity might be biased by the animals’ perception of novelty. We conducted judgment bias tests in mound-building mice phenotyped for their exploration tendency. After subjects had learned to distinguish between the positively and less-positively rewarded arms of a maze, a new ambiguous middle-arm was introduced. During the first test trial, more exploratory, less neophobic individuals displayed higher bidirectional locomotion in the ambiguous arm, indicating intensive exploration. Although this resulted in longer latencies to the reward in more exploratory animals, we conclude that this did not reflect a ‘more pessimistic judgment of ambiguity’. Indeed, during the following two trials, with increasing habituation to the ambiguous arm, the direction of the association was inversed compared to the first trial, as more exploratory individuals showed relatively shorter approach latencies. We suggest that in spatial test settings associating the ambiguous cue to novel areas, results can be confounded by subjects’ personality-dependent motivational conflict between exploration and reaching the reward. Findings obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with care.},

National guidelines on the topic have proven to be inaccurate. This paper reports the largest direct-to-patient international survey on these issues. Data generated by an online survey from 867 people from 31 countries, who had taken ADs continuously for at least one month, and had tried to come off (successfully or not) was analysed. The majority (59\%) had taken ADs for more than three years. Of those who were still taking them, 29\% had been doing so for at least 20 years. 61\% reported some degree of withdrawal effects, and 44\% of these described the effects as ‘severe’. The most common of six listed withdrawal effects were anxiety/panic (66\%) and irritability (62\%). The most common spontaneously reported ‘other’ withdrawal effect was suicidality (2\%). 40\% reported that they felt addicted, with 39\% of these describing their addiction as ‘severe’. Over half (55\%) reported some degree of difficulty coming off, with 27\% ticking ‘very difficult’, and 11\% ‘very easy’. Duration of treatment was related to withdrawal, addiction and difficulty coming off. Younger people experienced more frequent withdrawal effects. Only six people (0.7\%) recalled being told anything about withdrawal, dependence or addiction by the initial prescriber. These findings confirm previous studies, using a range of methodologies, finding high incidences of withdrawal effects, frequently at severe levels. National guidelines, and those of professional organisations, urgently need to be updated to reflect this evidence.},

  abstract = {The discovery of the rapid antidepressant effects of the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine, an uncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist, is arguably the most important breakthrough in depression research in the last 50\,years. Ketamine remains an off-label treatment for treatment-resistant depression with factors that limit widespread use including its dissociative effects and abuse potential. Ketamine is a racemic mixture, composed of equal amounts of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. An (S)-ketamine nasal spray has been developed and approved for use in treatment-resistant depression in the United States and Europe; however, some concerns regarding efficacy and side effects remain. Although (R)-ketamine is a less potent N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist than (S)-ketamine, increasing preclinical evidence suggests (R)-ketamine may have more potent and longer lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine, alongside fewer side effects. Furthermore, a recent pilot trial of (R)-ketamine has demonstrated rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Research is ongoing to determine the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of ketamine and its component enantiomers in an effort to develop future rapid-acting antidepressants that lack undesirable effects. Here, we briefly review findings regarding the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomers before considering underlying mechanisms including N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonism, γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneuron inhibition, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic receptor activation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin kinase B signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and inhibition of lateral habenula bursting, alongside potential roles of the monoaminergic and opioid receptor systems.},

  abstract = {Deficits in cognitive flexibility, the ability to modify behavior in response to changes in the environment, contribute to the onset and maintenance of stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as depression. Cognitive flexibility depends on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) function, and in depressed patients, cognitive inflexibility is associated with hypoactivity and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) exhibit compromised mPFC function on the extradimensional (ED) set-shifting task of the attentional set-shifting test. Moreover, CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with dendritic atrophy and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. This evidence suggests that impaired glutamate signaling may underlie stress-induced deficits in cognitive flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that blocking NMDA or AMPA receptors in the mPFC during ED replicated CUS-induced deficits in naïve rats. Secondly, we found that expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA, a marker of behaviorally induced glutamate-mediated plasticity, was increased in the mPFC following ED. We then showed that CUS compromised excitatory afferent activation of the mPFC following pharmacological stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), indicated by a reduced induction of c-fos expression. Subsequently, in vivo recordings of evoked potentials in the mPFC indicated that CUS impaired afferent activation of the mPFC evoked by MDT stimulation, but not the ventral hippocampus. Lastly, glutamate microdialysis showed that CUS attenuated the acute stress-evoked increase in extracellular glutamate in the mPFC. Together, these results demonstrate that CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with compromised glutamate neurotransmission in the mPFC.},

  abstract = {Fluoxetine, one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, has been thought to be effective for treating post-stroke depression (PSD). Recent work has shown that fluoxetine may exert an antidepressive effect through increasing the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. In the present study, we successfully established the PSD model using male C57BL/6\,J mice by photothrombosis of the left anterior cortex combined with isolatied-housing conditions. In the process, we confirmed that fluoxetine could improve the depression-like behaviors of PSD mice and upregulate the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. However, depletion of BDNF by transfecting lentivirus-derived shBDNF in hippocampus suppressed the effect of fluoxetine. Furthermore, we demonstrated the epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of BDNF expression induced by fluoxetine. We found a statistically significant increase in DNA methylation at specific CpG sites (loci 2) of Bdnf promoter IV in the hippocampus of PSD mice. We also found that fluoxetine treatment could disassociate the MeCP2-CREB-Bdnf promoter IV complex via phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421 by Protein Kinase A (PKA). Our research highlighted the importance of fluoxetine in regulating BDNF expression which could represent a potential strategy for preventing PSD.},

Typically, research articles and textbooks present and use p as a measure of statistical evidence against the null hypothesis (the Fisherian interpretation), although using concepts and tools based on a completely different usage of p as a tool for controlling long-term decision errors (the Neyman-Pearson interpretation). There are four major problems with using p as a measure of evidence and these problems are often overlooked in the domain of psychology. First, p is uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis and can therefore never indicate evidence for the null. Second, p is conditioned solely on the null hypothesis and is therefore unsuited to quantify evidence, because evidence is always relative in the sense of being evidence for or against a hypothesis relative to another hypothesis. Third, p designates probability of obtaining evidence (given the null), rather than strength of evidence. Fourth, p depends on unobserved data and subjective intentions and therefore implies, given the evidential interpretation, that the evidential strength of observed data depends on things that did not happen and subjective intentions. In sum, using p in the Fisherian sense as a measure of statistical evidence is deeply problematic, both statistically and conceptually, while the Neyman-Pearson interpretation is not about evidence at all. In contrast, the likelihood ratio escapes the above problems and is recommended as a tool for psychologists to represent the statistical evidence conveyed by obtained data relative to two hypotheses.},

It uses the encoding to recreate repeatedly the neocortical representation.

This paper is critical of that view and begins by raising four concerns. These include a question of how the hippocampus could encode the rich complexity of neocortical representations in sufficient detail to recreate them. And it observes that some data indicate episodic memories remain dependent on the hippocampus for life. Another view of hippocampal function is presented which addresses these concerns. Basically, this view hypothesizes that the ability to retrieve episodic memories involves the interplay between two modes of hippocampal function. Processes during the theta mode facilitate the development of context memory in the hippocampus and the registration of unique events in the neocortex, but block the influence of context memory upon the neocortex. By contrast, during the non-theta mode, context memory is projected onto the neocortex, creating a contextual framework. It is proposed that the ability to retrieve memory of episodes depends on the development, through contiguity, of associations between the representation of the episode (created during theta) and a contextual framework (evoked during non-theta). From this perspective, the episode does not need to be encoded in the hippocampus, but remains dependent indefinitely on associations formed between the episodic memory in the neocortex and a context memory maintained in hippocampal structures. However, for the associations that enable retrieval to form, the creation of the representation of an episode during theta must be followed quickly by the evocation of a contextual framework. During an extended period of the theta mode as occurs during REM sleep dreaming, these associations cannot usually be formed, resulting in amnesia for most dreams.},

  abstract = {Depression is a chronic disease that affects nearly twice as many women as men, and symptoms can differ by sex. Preclinical models disproportionately use male subjects and test a single behavioral endpoint immediately at the cessation of stress. We conducted variable stress in male and female mice for 6, 28, and 56 days, and measured behavior with a battery chosen to match research domain criteria. To examine individual differences, we generated a composite z score to measure stress susceptibility across behavioral tests. We also tested behavior following a 30-day recovery period to evaluate the duration of the stress effects. Females, but not males, were susceptible to 6 days of variable stress when behavioral testing started 24 h later. If behavioral testing was conducted 30 days later both males and females expressed stress related behaviors. Males and females were stress susceptible to 28 days of variable stress and effects were long lasting. Both sexes habituated to 56 days of variable stress, but anxiety associated measures still showed persistence. Performance on specific behavioral tests was often different between individuals and between sexes, and not all stressed animals were susceptible to all tested behaviors. These studies confirm that behavioral sex differences are detected in response to variable stress, and reveal information about individual differences. Use of a test battery that measures varying endophenotypes can be combined into a single stress susceptibility score as a tool similar to the scales/inventories used for the study of depression in humans. We present these data with the goal of furthering the field's understanding sex differences and how they shape the biology of mood disorders.},

  abstract = {Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, which necessitates novel therapeutics and biomarkers to approach treatment of this neuropsychiatric disorder. To assess potential mechanisms underlying the fast-acting antidepressant actions of ketamine we used a repeated corticosterone paradigm in adult male rats to assess the effects of ketamine on reelin-positive cells, a protein largely implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. We also assessed the effects of reelin and ketamine on hippocampal and cerebellar synpatosomes, and on serotonin transporter clustering in peripheral lymphocytes to determine reelin and ketamine's impact at the synaptic and peripheral levels. Reelin and ketamine similarly rescue synaptic expression of mTOR and p-mTOR that were decreased by corticosterone. Reelin, but not ketamine, was able to rescue patterns of serotonin transporter clustering in the periphery. These findings display ketamine as a powerful modulator of reelin expression and lend strength to further evaluation of the putative fast antidepressant-like actions of reelin.},

  abstract = {Multiple discriminant analysis and bivariate correlations of logarithms of progression indices are applied to volumetric data on 11 major brain regions of 139 species of Insectivora, Chiroptera, and Primates. The pattern of projections of the coordinate axes of original variates on the first two discriminant functions appears to correspond to MacLean's (1970) division of the brain into the neomammalian, paleomammalian and protoreptilian regions. However, the peculiar position of the neocortex may be somewhat exaggerated by collinearity. The brain components which undergo the greatest relative volumetric increase from basal Insectivora to higher Primates are, by order of decreasing importance, the neocortex, cerebellum, striatum, and diencephalon. The bulbus olfactorius and paleocortex are strongly correlated in Insectivora and prosimians, but this correlation drops abruptly in Chiroptera and in simians, where olfaction has regressed markedly while the paleocortex remained relatively stable, presumably by developing its non-olfactory functions. The neocortex, bulbus olfactorius, septum, schizocortex, and hippocampus are positively correlated in Chiroptera, apparently because they are large relative to body weight in Megachiroptera and frugivorous Microchiroptera but small in insectivorous Microchiroptera. The neocortex may be more useful in frugivorous and nectarivorous bats—for environment recognition based on visual and olfactory stimuli—and relatively less useful in insectivorous bats, which often must react rapidly to echolocative signals. The negative correlations of the medulla oblongata with the bulbus olfactorius and paleocortex, in progressive Insectivora, appear to reflect the evolutionary regression of olfaction and the compensatory progression of the tactile trigeminal system (vibrissae) in aquatic Insectivora.},

The present meta-analysis of radial maze and water maze experiments was conducted to assess the reliablility and magnitude of sex effects in the standard rodent models of learning and memory. Data were culled from published and unpublished sources. Findings indicate large reliable male advantages for rats in radial maze and water maze protocols. Significant strain differences were also identified. In each paradigm, protocol variations were associated with differential sex effects. For the water maze, smaller male advantages were associated with pretraining regimens and for the radial maze, larger significant male advantages were observed in protocols that included unbaited arms (combined reference and working memory protocols). Mouse studies exhibited a different pattern of sex effects; small female advantages were evident in the water maze, but small male advantages were evident in the radial maze. Together these findings establish the reliability of male advantages in spatial working and reference memory for rats across strains, protocols, ages and rearing environments. The findings also support an important species dichotomy between rats and mice that should be considered when transitioning from rat to mouse models. In light of these results, the biological evidence supporting theoretical explanations of sex differences is reviewed and evalualted.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the developmental process of generating and integrating new neurons in the hippocampus during adulthood and is a unique form of structural plasticity with enormous potential to modulate neural circuit function and behaviour. Dysregulation of this process is strongly linked to stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, and efforts have focused on unravelling the contribution of adult-born neurons in regulating stress response and recovery. Chronic stress has been shown to impair this process, whereas treatment with clinical antidepressants was found to enhance the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. However, the precise role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating the behavioural response to chronic stress is not clear and whether these adult-born neurons buffer or increase susceptibility to stress-induced mood-related maladaptation remains one of the controversial issues. In this review, we appraise evidence probing the causal role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the regulation of emotional behaviour in rodents. We find that the relationship between adult-born hippocampal neurons and stress-related mood disorders is not linear, and that simple subtraction or addition of these neurons alone is not sufficient to lead to anxiety/depression or have antidepressant-like effects. We propose that future studies examining how stress affects unique properties of adult-born neurons, such as the excitability and the pattern of connectivity during their critical period of maturation will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which these neurons contribute to functional outcomes in stress-related mood disorders.},

The recent introduction of a vast array of powerful new tools to probe and manipulate memory function at the cell and neuronal circuit level has spurred an explosion of interest in studying the engram. However, the present “engram renaissance” was not borne in isolation but rather builds on a long tradition of memory research. We believe it is important to acknowledge the debts our current generation of scientists owes to those scientists who have offered key ideas, persevered through failed experiments and made important discoveries before us. Examining the past can also offer a fresh perspective on the present state and future promise of the field. Given the large amount of empirical advances made in recent years, it seems particularly timely to look back and review the scientists who introduced the seminal terminology, concepts, methodological approaches, and initial data pertaining to engrams. Rather than simply list their many accomplishments, here we color in some details of the lives and milestone contributions of our seven personal heroes of the engram (Richard Semon, Karl Lashley, Donald Hebb, Wilder Penfield, Brenda Milner, James McConnell, and Richard Thompson). In reviewing their historic role, we also illustrate how their work remains relevant to today's studies.},

Engram cells active during context fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink owing to overlap with biocytin signals. Axons of the perforant path (green) express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin 2 and a fluorescent marker (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein). The upper blade of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer is revealed by the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue)., In 1904, Richard Semon introduced the term “engram” to describe the neural substrate for storing memories. An experience, Semon proposed, activates a subset of cells that undergo off-line, persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of this engram induces memory retrieval. Although Semon’s contributions were largely ignored in his lifetime, new technologies that allow researchers to image and manipulate the brain at the level of individual neurons has reinvigorated engram research. We review recent progress in studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an engram.

  abstract = {Aim Dietary nitrate (NO3−) supplementation increases nitric oxide bioavailability and can enhance exercise performance. We investigated the distribution and metabolic fate of ingested NO3− at rest and during exercise with a focus on skeletal muscle. Methods In a randomized, crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers consumed 12.8 mmol 15N-labeled potassium nitrate (K15NO3; NIT) or potassium chloride placebo (PLA). Muscle biopsies were taken at baseline, at 1- and 3-h post-supplement ingestion, and immediately following the completion of 60 maximal intermittent contractions of the knee extensors. Muscle, plasma, saliva, and urine samples were analyzed using chemiluminescence to determine absolute [NO3−] and [NO2−], and by mass spectrometry to determine the proportion of NO3− and NO2− that was 15N-labeled. Results Neither muscle [NO3−] nor [NO2−] were altered by PLA. Following NIT, muscle [NO3−] (but not [NO2−]) was elevated at 1-h (from 35 to 147 nmol/g, p {$<$} 0.001) and 3-h, with almost all of the increase being 15N-labeled. There was a significant reduction in 15N-labeled muscle [NO3−] from pre- to post-exercise. Relative to PLA, mean muscle torque production was 7\% greater during the first 18 contractions following NIT. This improvement in torque was correlated with the pre-exercise 15N-labeled muscle [NO3−] and the magnitude of decline in 15N-labeled muscle [NO3−] during exercise (r = 0.66 and r = 0.62, respectively; p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusion This study shows, for the first time, that skeletal muscle rapidly takes up dietary NO3−, the elevated muscle [NO3−] following NO3− ingestion declines during exercise, and muscle NO3− dynamics are associated with enhanced torque production during maximal intermittent muscle contractions.},

  abstract = {The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has created a blueprint for studying novel pharmaceuticals in the field. Recent studies suggest that “classic” serotonergic psychedelics (SPs) may also have antidepressant efficacy. Both ketamine and SPs appear to produce rapid, sustained antidepressant effects after a transient psychoactive period.This review summarizes areas of overlap between SP and ketamine research and considers the possibility of a common, downstream mechanism of action. The therapeutic relevance of the psychoactive state, overlapping cellular and molecular effects, and overlapping electrophysiological and neuroimaging observations are all reviewed.Taken together, the evidence suggests a potentially shared mechanism wherein both ketamine and SPs may engender rapid neuroplastic effects in a glutamatergic activity-dependent manner. It is postulated that, though distinct, both ketamine and SPs appear to produce acute alterations in cortical network activity that may initially produce psychoactive effects and later produce milder, sustained changes in network efficiency associated with therapeutic response. However, despite some commonalities between the psychoactive component of these pharmacologically distinct therapies—such as engagement of the downstream glutamatergic pathway—the connection between psychoactive impact and antidepressant efficacy remains unclear and requires more rigorous research.Rapid-acting antidepressants currently under investigation may share some downstream pharmacological effects, suggesting that their antidepressant effects may come about via related mechanisms. Given the prototypic nature of ketamine research and recent progress in this area, this platform could be used to investigate entirely new classes of antidepressants with rapid and robust actions.},

Various genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral animal models have long been used to establish animal anxiety-like and depression-like phenotypes, as well as to assess their memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. Mounting clinical and animal evidences strongly supports the notion that disturbed cognitions represent an important pathogenetic factor in anxiety and depression, and may also play a role in integrating the two disorders within a common stress-precipitated developmental pathway. This paper evaluates why and how the assessment of cognitive and emotional domains may improve our understanding of animal behaviors via different high-throughput tests and enable a better translation of animal phenotypes into human brain disorders.},

In addition, we assessed aggression and social barbering in these strains. Overall, the substantial differences observed here between these strains allow us to determine the influence of different genetic backgrounds on mouse behaviors, and more fully understand how different strain-specific behaviors overlap in the F1 progeny. Our results imply complex interplay between parental genotypes in anxiety, activity, grooming, aggression and barbering of their F1 progeny, further confirming the utility of F1 hybrids in behavioral neurogenetics.},

  abstract = {Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, which bear long polysaccharides called heparan sulfate (HS) attached to the core proteins. HSPGs interact with a variety of ligand proteins through the HS chains, and mutations in HSPG-related genes influence many biological processes and cause various diseases. In particular, recent findings from vertebrate and invertebrate studies have raised the importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HSPGs, glypicans, as central players in the development and functions of synapses. Glypicans are important components of the synapse-organizing protein complexes and serve as ligands for leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs), leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), and G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), regulating synapse formation. Many of these interactions are mediated by the HS chains of glypicans. Neurexins (Nrxs) are also synthesized as HSPGs and bind to some ligands in common with glypicans through HS chains. Therefore, glypicans and Nrxs may act competitively at the synapses. Furthermore, glypicans regulate the postsynaptic expression levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors, controlling the electrophysiological properties and non-canonical BMP signaling of synapses. Dysfunctions of glypicans lead to failures in neuronal network formation, malfunction of synapses, and abnormal behaviors that are characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent human genetics revealed that glypicans and HS are associated with autism spectrum disorder, neuroticism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we introduce the studies showing the roles of glypicans and HS in synapse formation, neural plasticity, and neurological disorders, especially focusing on the mouse and Drosophila as potential models for human diseases.},

  abstract = {The non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic capable of inducing analgesia, is known to have psychotomimetic actions, but the detailed mechanisms remain unclear because of its complex properties. The present study elucidated neural mechanisms of the effect of ketamine, at doses that exert psychotomimetic effects without anesthetic and analgesic effects, by evaluating cortical synaptic responses in vivo. Systemic administration (i.p.) of low (1 and 5 mg/kg), subanesthetic (25 mg/kg) and anesthetic (100 mg/kg) doses of ketamine dose-dependently decreased hippocampal stimulation-evoked potential in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in freely moving rats. The behavioral analysis assessed by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle response showed that ketamine (5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) produced PPI deficit. Thus, the psychotomimetic effects observed in ketamine-treated groups (5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) are associated with the induction of synaptic depression in the hippocampus-mPFC neural pathway. Based on these results, we further examined the underlying mechanisms of the ketamine-induced synaptic depression under anesthesia. Ketamine (5 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.) caused increases in dialysate dopamine in the mPFC in anesthetized rats. Moreover, the ketamine-induced decreases in the evoked potential, at the dose 5 mg/kg which has no anesthetic and analgesic effects, were indeed absent in dopamine-lesioned rats pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 150 μg/rat, i.c.v.). Ketamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced synaptic depression was blocked by pretreatment with dopamine D 1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (10 μg/rat, i.c.v.) but not dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), suggesting that dopaminergic modulation mediated via D 1 receptors are involved in the synaptic effects of ketamine. Furthermore, ketamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced synaptic depression was prevented also by GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.2 or 2 μg/rat, i.c.v.). These findings suggest that ketamine at the dose that exerts psychotomimetic symptoms depresses hippocampus-mPFC synaptic transmission through mechanisms involving dopaminergic modulation mediated via D 1 receptors, which may lead to a net augmentation of synaptic inhibition mediated via GABA A receptors. © 2011.},

Regarding tryptophan (Trp), the initial rate-limiting enzymes for the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism are tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Here, we generated mice deficient for tdo (Tdo-/-). Compared with wild-type littermates, Tdo-/- mice showed increased plasma levels of Trp and its metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and kynurenine, as well as increased levels of Trp, 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hippocampus and midbrain. These mice also showed anxiolytic modulation in the elevated plus maze and open field tests, and increased adult neurogenesis, as evidenced by double staining of BrdU and neural progenitor/neuronal markers. These findings demonstrate a direct molecular link between Trp metabolism and neurogenesis and anxiety-related behavior under physiological conditions.},

  abstract = {Purpose/aim of the study: To investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of endurance and resistance training on synaptic plasticity in chronic stressed depression rats. Materials and methods: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to establish depressive rats model. Healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (control, CUMS, AE, and RT). The animals in AE and RT groups were respectively subjected to continuous treadmill running and intermittent weight-bearing treadmill training for 8 weeks after CUMS. Forced swimming test (FST) was used to evaluate behavior of rats. The flow cytometry was used to detect the hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. LTP in hippocampal CA1 region were analyzed by electrophysiology. The expressions of various mRNA and proteins related to synaptic function were measured using RT-PCR, Western blot or immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus. Results: Results shown that rats exhibited depressive behavior after CUMS stimulation, specifically immobility time was increased and swimming time and climbing time were reduced in rats during FST. After training, AE and RT all attenuated CUMS-induced depressive behavior of rats. AE and RT reduced apoptosis rate of hippocampal neuron and increased PS amplitude and fEPSPs slope after CUMS stimulation. After CUMS stimulation, AE promoted mRNA expressions, including BDNF, mTOR, TrkB, Syn, Syp, CaMKIIβ, and DRD5, and increased protein expressions, including IGF-1, PGC-1α, ERRβ, and FNDC5. While RT promoted mRNA expressions, including IGF-1, mTOR, Akt, Syn, and Syp, and improved protein expressions, including IGF-1, IGF-1R, and p-Akt. Conclusions: In conclusion, AE and RT for 8 weeks improved CUMS-induced depressive behavior, neuron injury and synaptic plasticity through regulating different signaling pathways.},

Yet, despite this prominence, AI is still a surprisingly fuzzy concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this article, we analyze how AI is different from related concepts, such as the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that AI is not one monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This can either be achieved by looking at AI through the lens of evolutionary stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of AI systems (analytical AI, human-inspired AI, and humanized AI). Based on this classification, we show the potential and risk of AI using a series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control.},

To investigate how antidepressants influence the response of mood-related systems to behavioral experience, we used a fear-conditioning and extinction paradigm in mice. Combining extinction training with chronic fluoxetine, but neither treatment alone, induced an enduring loss of conditioned fear memory in adult animals. Fluoxetine treatment increased synaptic plasticity, converted the fear memory circuitry to a more immature state, and acted through local brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Fluoxetine-induced plasticity may allow fear erasure by extinction-guided remodeling of the memory circuitry.

To study the individual contributions of diet and peripheral insulin resistance to learning and memory, we used a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase-1 in adipocytes, which inhibits the insulin receptor. Here, we demonstrate that a model of peripheral insulin resistance exacerbates high-fat diet induced deficits in performance on the Morris Water Maze task. This finding was then reviewed in the context of the greater literature to explore potential mechanisms including triglyceride storage, adiponectin, lipid composition, insulin signaling, oxidative stress, and hippocampal signaling. Together, these findings further our understanding of the complex relationship among peripheral insulin resistance, diet and memory.},

We show that as new granule cells mature, they are increasingly likely to be incorporated into circuits supporting spatial memory. By the time the cells are 4 or more weeks of age, they are more likely than existing granule cells to be recruited into circuits supporting spatial memory.

It co-translationally targets proteins with a signal sequence to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protects their mRNA from degradation. If SRP is depleted or cannot recognize the signal sequence, then the Regulation of Aberrant Protein Production (RAPP) is activated, which results in the loss of secretory protein mRNA. If SRP recognizes the substrates but is unable to target them to ER, they may mislocalize or degrade. All these events lead to dramatic consequence for protein biogenesis, activating protein quality control pathways, and creating pressure on cell physiology, and might lead to the pathogenesis of disease. Indeed, SRP dysfunction is involved in many different human diseases, including: congenital neutropenia; idiopathic inflammatory myopathy; viral, protozoal, and prion infections; and cancer. In this work, we analyze diseases caused by SRP failure and discuss their possible molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Why does the adult brain go through the considerable effort to maintain the machinery necessary for neurogenesis? Why does neurogenesis persist in two brain regions and not in others? Whereas early reflections on this topic tended to regard adult hippocampal neurogenesis a mere atavism with little or no functional consequences, this evaluation has begun to change in the last few years. We now hypothesize that adult neurogenesis is necessary for hippocampal function. In the hippocampus, information is processed in order to consolidate memory, hence the emblematic description of the hippocampus as ‘the gateway to memory’. In our view, new neurons are added to the hippocampal dentate gyrus not to increase memory per se, but to optimize the network by strategic insertion of ‘new gatekeepers at the gateway to memory’. Optimization means the smallest (and fastest) possible network that is able to cope with the degree of novelty and complexity an individual experiences. Data on the experience- and activity-dependent regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis support this view. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a long-term adjustment of the hippocampus to functional needs, not means for acute changes in the sense of ‘putting in more memory, while the computer is running’. What lies ahead is to find out, which molecular rules govern this long-term plasticity. To consider functional implications of adult hippocampal neurogenesis also begins to influence concepts of hippocampal disease, for example certain aspects of epilepsia and major depression.},

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is also found in humans at a considerable level and appears to contribute significantly to hippocampal plasticity across the life span, because it is regulated by activity. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis generates new excitatory granule cells in the dentate gyrus, whose axons form the mossy fiber tract that links the dentate gyrus to CA3. It originates from a population of radial glia-like precursor cells (type 1 cells) that have astrocytic properties, express markers of neural stem cells and divide rarely. They give rise to intermediate progenitor cells with first glial (type 2a) and then neuronal (type 2b) phenotype. Through a migratory neuroblast-like stage (type 3), the newborn, lineage-committed cells exit the cell cycle and enter a maturation stage, during which they extend their dendrites into a the molecular layer and their axon to CA3. They go through a period of several weeks, during which they show increased synaptic plasticity, before finally becoming indistinguishable from the older granule cells., Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a key role in certain cognitive functions (e.g., memory). It is a complex, multistep process that generates new excitatory granule cells in the dentate gyrus.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a unique and exceptional process in the mammalian brain that in a lifelong and activity-dependent way generates new excitatory principal neurons. A comprehensive view on their function in greater contexts has now emerged, revealing to which extent the hippocampus (and hence brain and mind) depend on these neurons. Due to a postmitotic period of heightened synaptic plasticity they bias incoming excitation to the dentate gyrus to non-overlapping subnetworks, resulting in pattern separation and the avoidance of catastrophic interference. Temporally, this promotes the flexible integration of novel information into familiar contexts and contributes to episodic memory, which in humans would be critical for autobiographic memory. Together these local effects represent a unique strategy to solve the plasticity-stability dilemma that all learning neuronal networks are facing. Neurogenesis-dependent plasticity also improves memory consolidation. This relates to the surprising involvement of adult neurogenesis in forgetting, which is also hypothesized to be critically relevant for negative plasticity, for example in post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, adult-born neurons also directly mediate stress-resilience and take part in affective behaviors. Finally, the activity- and experience-dependent plasticity that is contributed by adult neurogenesis is associated with an individualization of the hippocampal circuitry. While a solid and largely consensual understanding of how new neurons contribute to hippocampal function has been reached, an overarching unifying theory that embeds neurogenesis-dependent functionality and effects on connectomics is still missing. More sophisticated multi-electrode electrophysiology, advanced ethologically relevant behavioral tests, and next-generation computational modeling will let us take the next steps.},

  abstract = {Antidepressant prescribing has increased year on year since the introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the 1980s. More than 10\% of adults in England are now taking antidepressants for depression/anxiety, with a median length of treatment of more than 2 years, but antidepressants can cause side effects and withdrawal symptoms which increase with longer use. Surveys of antidepressant users suggest 30–50\% have no evidence-based indication to continue, but coming off antidepressants is often difficult due to fears of relapse, withdrawal symptoms and a lack of psychological treatments to replace maintenance treatment and prevent relapse. GPs should not prescribe antidepressants routinely for mild depressive/anxiety symptoms. Patients starting antidepressants should be advised that they are to be taken for a limited period only, and that there is a risk of withdrawal problems on stopping them. Prescribers should actively review long-term antidepressant use and suggest coming off them slowly to patients who are well. The relationship between SSRI dose and serotonin transporter receptor occupancy suggests that hyperbolic tapering regimes may be helpful for patients with troubling withdrawal symptoms who cannot stop treatment within 4–8 weeks, and tapering strips can allow carefully titrated slower dose reduction over some months. Internet and telephone support to patients wanting to reduce their antidepressants is being trialled in the REDUCE programme. More research is needed to establish the incidence of withdrawal symptoms in representative samples of patients coming off antidepressants, and large randomised controlled trials are needed to test different tapering strategies.},

  abstract = {From a behavioral perspective, the CA3a,b subregion of the hippocampus plays an important role in the encoding of new spatial information within short-term memory with a duration of seconds and minutes. This can easily be observed in tasks that require rapid encoding, novelty detection, one-trial short-term or working memory, and one-trial cued recall primarily for spatial information. These are tasks that have been assumed to reflect the operations of episodic memory and require interactions between CA3a,b and the dentate gyrus via mossy fiber inputs into the CA3a,b. The CA3a,b is also important for encoding of spatial information requiring multiple trials including the acquisition of arbitrary and relational associations. These tasks tend to be non-episodic and can be mediated by arbitrary and conjunctive operations. All these tasks are assumed to operate within an autoassociative network function of the CA3 region. The output from CA3a,b via the fimbria and the medial and lateral perforant path inputs play a supporting role in the neural circuit that supports the operation of these tasks. The CA3a,b also plays a role in sequential processing of information in cooperation with CA1 based on the Schaffer collateral output from CA3a,b to CA1. The CA3a,b also supports retrieval of short-term memory information based on a spatial pattern completion process. Finally, CA3c may, in cooperation with the dentate gyrus, serve an important role in processing the geometry of the environment.},

This narrowing of the drug-placebo difference has been attributed to a number of changes in the conduct of clinical trials. First, the advent of DSM-III and the broadening of the definition of major depression have led to the inclusion of mildly to moderately ill patients into antidepressant trials. These patients may experience a smaller magnitude of antidepressant-placebo differences. Second, drug development regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, have had a significant, albeit underappreciated, role in determining how modern antidepressant clinical trials are designed and conducted. Their concerns about possible false positive results have led to trial designs that are poor, difficult to conduct, and complicated to analyze. Attempts at better design and patient selection for antidepressant trials have not yielded the expected results.

  abstract = {Mouse-tracking – the analysis of mouse movements in computerized experiments – is becoming increasingly popular in the cognitive sciences. Mouse movements are taken as an indicator of commitment to or conflict between choice options during the decision process. Using mouse-tracking, researchers have gained insight into the temporal development of cognitive processes across a growing number of psychological domains. In the current article, we present software that offers easy and convenient means of recording and analyzing mouse movements in computerized laboratory experiments. In particular, we introduce and demonstrate the mousetrap plugin that adds mouse-tracking to OpenSesame, a popular general-purpose graphical experiment builder. By integrating with this existing experimental software, mousetrap allows for the creation of mouse-tracking studies through a graphical interface, without requiring programming skills. Thus, researchers can benefit from the core features of a validated software package and the many extensions available for it (e.g., the integration with auxiliary hardware such as eye-tracking, or the support of interactive experiments). In addition, the recorded data can be imported directly into the statistical programming language R using the mousetrap package, which greatly facilitates analysis. Mousetrap is cross-platform, open-source and available free of charge from https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os.},

Rats were classically conditioned to fear both tone and context through the use of aversive foot shocks. Lesions were made in the hippocampus either 1, 7, 14, or 28 days after training. Contextual fear was abolished in the rats that received lesions 1 day after fear conditioning. However, rats for which the interval between learning and hippocampal lesions was longer retained significant contextual fear memory. In the same animals, lesions did not affect fear response to the tone at any time. These results indicate that fear memory is not a single process and that the hippocampus may have a time-limited role in associative fear memories evoked by polymodal (contextual) but not unimodal (tone) sensory stimuli.},

  abstract = {Electrolytic lesions to the amygdala, a limbic structure implicated in stress-related behaviors and memory modulation, have been shown to prevent stress-induced impairments of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory in rats. The present study investigated the role of intrinsic amygdalar neurons in mediating stress effects on the hippocampus by microinfusing the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol into the amygdala and examining stress effects on Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 LTP and spatial memory. The critical period of the amygdalar contribution to stress effects on hippocampal functions was determined by applying muscimol either before stress or immediately after stress. Our results indicate that intra-amygdalar muscimol infusions before uncontrollable restraint-tailshock stress effectively blocked stress-induced physiological and behavioral effects. Specifically, hippocampal slices prepared from vehicle-infused stressed animals exhibited markedly impaired LTP, whereas slices obtained from muscimol-infused stressed animals demonstrated robust LTP comparable with that of unstressed animals. Correspondingly, vehicle-infused stressed animals displayed impaired spatial memory (on a hidden platform version of the Morris water maze task), whereas muscimol-infused stressed animals revealed unimpaired spatial memory. In contrast to prestress muscimol effects, however, immediate poststress infusions of muscimol into the amygdala failed to interfere with stress impairments of LTP and spatial memory. Together, these results suggest that the amygdalar neuronal activity during stress, but not shortly after stress, is essential for the emergence of stress-induced alterations in hippocampal LTP and memory.},

Behaviorally, human and animal studies have found that stress generally impairs various hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Neurally, animal studies have revealed that stress alters ensuing synaptic plasticity and firing properties of hippocampal neurons. Structurally, human and animal studies have shown that stress changes neuronal morphology, suppresses neuronal proliferation, and reduces hippocampal volume. Since the inception of stress research nearly 80 years ago, much focus has been on the varying levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine hormones, namely glucocorticoids, as mediators of the myriad stress effects on the hippocampus and as contributing factors to stress-associated psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, reports of glucocorticoid-produced alterations in hippocampal functioning vary widely across studies. This review provides a brief history of stress research, examines how the glucocorticoid hypothesis emerged and guides contemporary stress research, and considers alternative approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying stress effects on hippocampal functioning.},

All 9 strains showed diverse basal levels of cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and integration into granule cells in the sedentary group. C57BL/6 mice showed the highest levels of cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and integration into granule cells at basal levels, and the DBA/2 mice showed the lowest levels. The efficacy of integration into granule cells was maximal in ICR mice. Treadmill exercise increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in all 9 mouse strains. These results suggest that the genetic background of mice affects hippocampal neurogenesis and C57BL/6 mice are the most useful strain to assess basal levels of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, but not maturation into granule cells.

Here, we record putative granule~cells (GCs) and mossy~cells (MCs) from the dentate gyrus (DG) over 27 days as mice repetitively run through a sequence of objects fixed onto a treadmill belt. We observe a progressive transformation of GC spatial representations, from a sparse encoding of object locations and spatial patterns to increasingly more single, evenly dispersed place fields, while MCs show little transformation and preferentially encode object locations. A competitive learning model of the DG reproduces GC transformations via the progressive integration of landmark-vector cells and spatial inputs and requires MC-mediated feedforward inhibition to evenly distribute GC representations, suggesting that GCs slowly encode conjunctions of objects and spatial information via competitive learning, while MCs help homogenize GC spatial representations.},

  abstract = {Stressful experiences, both physical and psychological, that are overwhelming (i.e., inescapable and unpredictable), can measurably affect subsequent neuronal properties and cognitive functioning of the hippocampus. At the cellular level, stress has been shown to alter hippocampal synaptic plasticity, spike and local field potential activity, dendritic morphology, neurogenesis, and neurodegeneration. At the behavioral level, stress has been found to impair learning and memory for declarative (or explicit) tasks that are based on cognition, such as verbal recall memory in humans and spatial memory in rodents, while facilitating those that are based on emotion, such as differential fear conditioning in humans and contextual fear conditioning in rodents. These vertically related alterations in the hippocampus, procedurally observed after subjects have undergone stress, are generally believed to be mediated by recurrently elevated circulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effector hormones, glucocorticoids, directly acting on hippocampal neurons densely populated with corticosteroid receptors. The main purposes of this review are to (i) provide a synopsis of the neurocognitive effects of stress in a historical context that led to the contemporary HPA axis dogma of basic and translational stress research, (ii) critically reappraise the necessity and sufficiency of the glucocorticoid hypothesis of stress, and (iii) suggest an alternative metaparadigm approach to monitor and manipulate the progression of stress effects at the neural coding level. Real-time analyses can reveal neural activity markers of stress in the hippocampus that can be used to extrapolate neurocognitive effects across a range of stress paradigms (i.e., resolve scaling and dichotomous memory effects issues) and understand individual differences, thereby providing a novel neurophysiological scaffold for advancing future stress research.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its end-effectors glucocorticoid hormones play central roles in the adaptive response to numerous stressors that can be either internal or external. Thus, this system has a strong impact on the brain hippocampus and its major functions, such as cognition, memory as well as behavior, and mood. The hippocampal area of the adult brain contains neural stem cells or more committed neural progenitor cells, which retain throughout the human life the ability of self-renewal and to differentiate into multiple neural cell lineages, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, these characteristic cells contribute significantly to the above-indicated functions of the hippocampus, while various stressors and glucocorticoids influence proliferation, differentiation, and fate of these cells. This review offers an overview of the current understanding on the interactions between the HPA axis/glucocorticoid stress-responsive system and hippocampal neural progenitor cells by focusing on the actions of glucocorticoids. Also addressed is a further discussion on the implications of such interactions to the pathophysiology of mood disorders.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Educators’ attitudes regarding their application, expectations, and concerns are very important in the emergence and introduction of new technological tools in education. The current paper aims to explore the opinion of university professors at a Bulgarian university regarding the possibilities and challenges of ChatGPT in carrying out teaching activities. The findings of the conducted survey show that university professors from Trakia University in Bulgaria have an overall positive attitude regarding the implementation of ChatGPT in their teaching practice (41.4\%). They perceive ChatGPT as a means to support time-consuming teaching activities (60.9\%), provoke interest, activate and engage learners (59.8\%), and stimulate their critical thinking and creativity (47.1\%). In parallel, the university professors are concerned about possible risks of its unethical use that threaten the validity and fairness of assessment practices. The most severe problem for them is the danger that learners will completely trust ChatGPT without checking the authenticity of the generated texts (73.6\%), which can negatively affect the acquisition of knowledge and skills.},

  abstract = {A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not fully understood. In the dentate gyrus, chronic fluoxetine treatment induces increased excitability of mature granule cells (GCs) as well as neurogenesis. The major input to the dentate gyrus is the perforant path axons (boutons) from the entorhinal cortex (layer II). Through voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that the excitatory neurotransmission of the perforant path synapse onto the GCs in the middle molecular layer of the mouse dentate gyrus (perforant path-GC synapse) is enhanced after chronic fluoxetine treatment (15 mg/kg/day, 14 days). Therefore, we further examined whether chronic fluoxetine treatment affects the morphology of the perforant path-GC synapse, using FIB/SEM (focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy). A three-dimensional reconstruction of dendritic spines revealed the appearance of extremely large-sized spines after chronic fluoxetine treatment. The large-sized spines had a postsynaptic density with a large volume. However, chronic fluoxetine treatment did not affect spine density. The presynaptic boutons that were in contact with the large-sized spines were large in volume, and the volumes of the mitochondria and synaptic vesicles inside the boutons were correlated with the size of the boutons. Thus, the large-sized perforant path-GC synapse induced by chronic fluoxetine treatment contains synaptic components that correlate with the synapse size and that may be involved in enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission.},

In this paper, we first review how memory becomes hippocampal dependent to cortical dependent with an emphasis on the interactions that occur between the HPC and cortex during systems consolidation. We also review the mechanisms underlying the gradual decay of HPC dependency during systems consolidation from the perspective of memory erasures by adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we discuss the relationship between systems consolidation and memory precision.},

However, the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation have thus far been unknown. We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for remote contextual fear memory, were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.},

  abstract = {Obesity is currently one of the most serious threats to human health in the western civilization. A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Physical exercise not only improves fitness but it has also been shown in human and animal studies to increase hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and physical exercise both modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated to play a role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, particularly flexible memory expression. Here, we investigated the effects of twelve weeks of HFD vs. control diet (CD) and voluntary physical activity (wheel running; -R) vs. inactivity (sedentary; -S) on hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning and flexible memory function in female C57Bl/6 mice assessed in the Morris water maze. HFD was initiated either in adolescent mice combined with long-term concurrent exercise (preventive approach) or in young adult mice with 14 days of subsequent exercise (therapeutic approach). HFD resulted in impaired flexible memory expression only when initiated in adolescent (HFD-S) but not in young adult mice, which was successfully prevented by concurrent exercise (HFD-R). Histological analysis revealed a reduction of immature neurons in the hippocampus of the memory-impaired HFD-S mice of the preventive approach. Long-term physical exercise also led to accelerated spatial learning during the acquisition period, which was accompanied by increased numbers of newborn mature neurons (HFD-R and CD-R). Short-term exercise of 14 days in the therapeutic group was not effective in improving spatial learning or memory. We show that (1) alterations in learning and flexible memory expression are accompanied by changes in the number of neuronal cells at different maturation stages; (2) these neuronal cells are in turn differently affected by HFD; (3) adolescent mice are specifically susceptible to the negative effects of HFD. Thus, physical exercise, by modulating adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, might represent a potential preventive approach for treating cognitive impairments associated with adolescent obesity.},

  abstract = {Serotonergic antidepressant drugs have been commonly used to treat mood and anxiety disorders, and increasing evidence suggests potential use of these drugs beyond current antidepressant therapeutics. Facilitation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus has been suggested to be a candidate mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs, but this mechanism may be only one of the broad effects of antidepressants. Here we show a distinct unique action of the serotonergic antidepressant fluoxetine in transforming the phenotype of mature dentate granule cells. Chronic treatments of adult mice with fluoxetine strongly reduced expression of the mature granule cell marker calbindin. The fluoxetine treatment induced active somatic membrane properties resembling immature granule cells and markedly reduced synaptic facilitation that characterizes the mature dentate-to-CA3 signal transmission. These changes cannot be explained simply by an increase in newly generated immature neurons, but best characterized as “dematuration” of mature granule cells. This granule cell dematuration developed along with increases in the efficacy of serotonin in 5-HT4 receptor-dependent neuromodulation and was attenuated in mice lacking the 5-HT4 receptor. Our results suggest that serotonergic antidepressants can reverse the established state of neuronal maturation in the adult hippocampus, and up-regulation of 5-HT4 receptor-mediated signaling may play a critical role in this distinct action of antidepressants. Such reversal of neuronal maturation could affect proper functioning of the mature hippocampal circuit, but may also cause some beneficial effects by reinstating neuronal functions that are lost during development.},

Animal models have been widely employed for the investigation of the neurobiology of such disorders and the discovery of new treatments. However, mostly male animals have been used in preclinical pharmacological studies. In this review, we highlight the need for the inclusion of both male and female animals in experimental studies aiming at gender-oriented prevention, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders. We present behavioural findings on sex differences from animal models of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. Moreover, when available, we include studies conducted across different stages of the oestrous cycle. By inspection of the relevant literature, it is obvious that robust sex differences exist in models of all psychiatric disorders. However, many times results are conflicting, and no clear conclusion regarding the direction of sex differences and the effect of the oestrous cycle is drawn. Moreover, there is a lack of considerable amount of studies using psychiatric drugs in both male and female animals, in order to evaluate the differential response between the two sexes. Notably, while in most cases animal models successfully mimic drug response in both sexes, test parameters and treatment-sensitive behavioural indices are not always the same for male and female rodents. Thus, there is an increasing need to validate animal models for both sexes and use standard procedures across different laboratories.},

The influence of a given gene on a specific behavior can be determined by behavioral analysis of mutant mice. If a target gene is expressed in the brain, behavioral phenotype of the mutant mice could elucidate the genetic mechanism of normal behaviors. The elevated plus maze test is one of the most widely used tests for measuring anxiety-like behavior. The test is based on the natural aversion of mice for open and elevated areas, as well as on their natural spontaneous exploratory behavior in novel environments. The apparatus consists of open arms and closed arms, crossed in the middle perpendicularly to each other, and a center area. Mice are given access to all of the arms and are allowed to move freely between them. The number of entries into the open arms and the time spent in the open arms are used as indices of open space-induced anxiety in mice. Unfortunately, the procedural differences that exist between laboratories make it difficult to duplicate and compare results among laboratories. Here, we present a detailed movie demonstrating our protocol for the elevated plus maze test. In our laboratory, we have assessed more than 90 strains of mutant mice using the protocol shown in the movie. These data will be disclosed as a part of a public database that we are now constructing. Visualization of the protocol will promote better understanding of the details of the entire experimental procedure, allowing for standardization of the protocols used in different laboratories and comparisons of the behavioral phenotypes of various strains of mutant mice assessed using this test.},

In this study, 98 unipolar depressed adults who failed at least one antidepressant medication were randomized 2:1 to a single infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.5\,mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) and completed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) assessments at pre-infusion baseline and 24-h post-infusion. DTI mean diffusivity (DTI-MD), a putative marker of microstructural neuroplasticity in gray matter, was calculated for 7 regions of interest (left and right BA10, amygdala, and hippocampus; and ventral Anterior Cingulate Cortex) and compared to clinical response measured with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Report (QIDS-SR). Individual differences in DTI-MD change (greater decrease from baseline to 24-h post-infusion, indicative of more neuroplasticity enhancement) were associated with larger improvements in depression scores across several regions. In the left BA10 and left amygdala, these relationships were driven primarily by the ketamine group (group\,*\,DTI-MD interaction effects: p\,=\,0.016–0.082). In the right BA10, these associations generalized to both infusion arms (p\,=\,0.007). In the left and right hippocampus, on the MADRS only, interaction effects were observed in the opposite direction, such that DTI-MD change was inversely associated with depression change in the ketamine arm specifically (group\,*\,DTI-MD interaction effects: p\,=\,0.032–0.06). The acute effects of ketamine on depression may be mediated, in part, by acute changes in neuroplasticity quantifiable with DTI.},

  abstract = {In the Morris water maze, a task widely used to study spatial learning and memory in laboratory rodents, several parameters are employed to estimate cognitive abilities of animals by analyzing their swim path characteristics. An isolated view based on any one of these parameters is not always satisfactory, so multivariate procedures (factor analyses) are used to weight the parameters in context with the others. This method sheds light on some subtle differences in experimental animals' spatial memories or strategies. However, this approach has some subjective problems, because the definition of the parameters depends on the experimenter's opinion of appropriate measures; therefore, we suggest a bottom-up rather than a top-down analysis of swim paths by means of spatial coordinates. In the present study, swim paths were normalized to 100-element vectors and then subjected to a principal components analysis. Swim paths could be sufficiently described in terms of only three components, each of which accounted for specific characteristics of the trajectories. We found significant differences in swim path patterns between test groups of rats that could not be discriminated via standard water maze parameters. Thus, the components can be related to different aspects of spatial cognition not detectable by commonly used parameters.},

  abstract = {Rationale and objectives: Cognitive deficits, including an impaired ability to shift perceptual attentional set, belong to the core features of schizophrenia, are associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunctions, and may involve glutamate NMDA receptors. Although phencyclidine disturbs cognitive flexibility, little is known about the effects of ketamine and other NMDA antagonists that differ in receptor subunit selectivity, particularly in the mouse species. Methods: At different times following the administration of ketamine, the NMDA NR2B-subtype specific antagonist Ro 25-6981, or the atypical antipsychotic sertindole, male C57Bl/6J mice were investigated in a modified version of attentional set-shifting task (ASST). Results: Specific extra-dimensional shift (EDS) deficit was observed in all control mice. As revealed by the increased number of trials, time and errors to reach criterion, ketamine at 10 or 20 mg/kg given 50 min prior to sessions, but not at 10 mg/kg given 3 or 24 h prior to sessions, further worsened the EDS performance. Sertindole (2.5 mg/kg) prevented ketamine-induced cognitive inflexibility, although it did not affect ASST performance when given alone. In contrast to ketamine, Ro 25-6981 at 10 but not 3 mg/kg, reduced the number of trials and errors to criterion, suggesting a facilitation of cognitive flexibility. Finally, as revealed by the number of trials and time to criterion measures, Ro 25-6981 (10 mg/kg) administration to ketamine (10 mg/kg)-pretreated mice inhibited ketamine-induced cognitive inflexibility. Conclusion: The present study provides an improved and reliable mouse ASST protocol and confirms and extends previous findings demonstrating that NR2B subunit-selective antagonists improve cognitive processes. © 2010 The Author(s).},

One of the factors identified as significant in this regard is the constellation of beliefs that includes a mourner’s thoughts about the circumstances of the death, their feelings about the person who died, their reflections on the relationship with that person, and their assessment of their own ability to survive the loss. This paper considers the role of cognition in adaptation to loss, and demonstrates how maladaptive cognitions concerning the loss, the manner of death or the relationship with the deceased can interfere with adaptation and lead to complications in grief. Case examples illustrate the use of CBT with bereaved clients and the benefits of this approach as part of an overall strategy for helping grieving clients. The effectiveness of CBT with bereaved individuals is enhanced when clients understand the rationale of the treatment and are committed to carrying out the tasks specified in their treatment plan.

  abstract = {Memantine and ketamine block N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with similar affinity and kinetics, yet their behavioral consequences differ: e.g., memantine is used to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, whereas ketamine reproduces symptoms of schizophrenia. The two drugs exhibit different pharmacokinetics, which may play a principal role in their differential behavioral effects. To gain insight into the drugs' behavioral consequences, we treated adult male rats acutely with varying doses (0-40 mg/kg i.p.) of memantine or ketamine and assessed exploratory behavior and spatial working memory. To examine the importance of pharmacokinetics, we assessed behavior either 15 or 45 min after drug administration. Both drugs decreased ambulation, fine movements, and rearing at the beginning of the exploratory activity test; however, at the end of the test, high doses of only memantine increased ambulation and fine movements. High doses of both drugs disrupted spontaneous alternation, a measure of working memory, but high doses of only memantine elicited perseverative behavior. Surprisingly, ketamine's effects were influenced by the delay between drug administration and testing no more frequently than were memantine's. Our findings show that, regardless of test delay, memantine and ketamine evoke similar behavioral effects at lower doses, consistent with NMDA receptors being both drugs' principal site of action, but can have divergent effects at higher doses. Our results suggest that the divergence of memantine's and ketamine's behavioral consequences is likely to result from differences in mechanisms of NMDA receptor antagonism or actions at other targets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Despite being different disorders, symptoms of depression and anxiety frequently overlap in individuals, making them difficult to diagnose and treat adequately. Therefore, compounds capable of exerting beneficial effects against both disorders are of special interest. Noteworthily, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, and individuals with these psychiatric conditions have low serum levels of this vitamin. Indeed, in the last few years, vitamin D has gained attention for its many functions that go beyond its effects on calcium–phosphorus metabolism. Particularly, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pro-neurogenic, and neuromodulatory properties seem to contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Therefore, in this review, we highlight the main mechanisms that may underlie the potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss preclinical and clinical studies that support the therapeutic potential of this vitamin for the management of these disorders.},

  abstract = {The capability of the mammalian brain to generate new neurons through the lifespan has gained much attention for the promise of new therapeutic possibilities especially for the aging brain. One of the brain regions that maintains a neurogenesis‐permissive environment is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Here, new neurons are generated from a pool of multipotent neural progenitor cells to become fully functional neurons that are integrated into the brain circuitry. A growing body of evidence points to the fact that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus is necessary for certain memory processes, and in mood regulation, while alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis have been associated with a myriad of neurological and psychiatric disorders. More recently, evidence has come to light that new neurons may differ in their vulnerability to environmental and disease‐related influences depending on the time during the life course at which they are exposed. Thus, it has been the topic of intense research in recent years. In this review, we will discuss the complex process and associated functional relevance of hippocampal neurogenesis during the embryonic/postnatal period and in adulthood. We consider the implications of hippocampal neurogenesis during the developmentally critical periods of adolescence and older age. We will further consider the literature surrounding hippocampal neurogenesis and its functional role during these critical periods with a view to providing insight into the potential of harnessing neurogenesis for health and therapeutic benefit.},

  abstract = {Background: Ketamine's antidepressant effects are thought to be elicited by rapid changes in synaptic plasticity, however onset and timing of these neuroplastic changes is unresolved. A study in a rat model of depression demonstrated that apical dendritic spine deficits in CA1 pyramidal neurons were rapidly restored within one hour (1). In this study, we aimed to translate immediate effects of ketamine on CA1 structure in healthy human subjects with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hippocampal subfield measurements. Method(s): We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover MRI study with in 31 healthy subjects (14f, mean age 25.2). We conducted two structural T1-weighted MRIs (3T, MPRAGE) within a single session, one before and one 45min after infusion of S-ketamine (bolus of 0.11mg/kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.12mg/kg over 20 min). At a second time-point all subjects received placebo (0.9\% NaCl). We calculated volume differences 'post-pre ketamine/placebo for dentate gyrus subfields (as measured with FreeSurfer 6.0; CA1, CA3, CA4, GC\_ML\_DG, both hemispheres) and compared these with t-tests. Result(s): During MRI scanning, subjects received 7.6+/-1.5 mg esketamine, corresponding to a total dose of 0.11mg/kg body weight. Although psychotomimetic effects were evident, there was no significant volume changes in dentate gyrus' subfield volumes 45min after ketamine compared to placebo (all uncorrected p{$>$}0.05). Conclusion(s): We did not detect volume increases in subfield layers of the human hippocampus. However, these results are valuable for future studies. To detail increases in dentate gyrus volumes, future translational studies should evaluate higher ketamine doses and later time-points of measurements.

Our goal was to update the current assumptions and investigate the extent of cognitive impairment in depression in the acute and remitted state. A systematic review of the existing literature between 2009 and 2019 assessing the risk of bias within the included studies was performed. Of the 42 articles reviewed, an unclear risk of bias was shown overall. The risk of bias mainly concerned the sample selection, inadequate remedial measures, as well as the lack of blinding the assessors. In the acute phase, we found strong support for impairment in processing speed, learning, and memory. Follow-up studies and direct comparisons revealed less pronounced deficits in remission, however, deficits were still present in attention, learning and memory, and working memory. A positive correlation between the number of episodes and cognitive deficits as well as depression severity and cognitive deficits was reported. The results also demonstrate a resemblance between the cognitive profiles in bipolar disorder and depression. Comparisons of depression with schizophrenia led to unclear results, at times suggesting an overlap in cognitive performance. The main findings support the global deficit hypothesis and align with results from prior meta-analyses and reviews. Recommendations for future research are also presented.},

Two strengths of the mixed model are (1) the ability to accommodate missing data points often encountered in longitudinal datasets and (2) the ability to model nonlinear, individual characteristics. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the advantages of using the mixed model for analyzing nonlinear, longitudinal datasets with multiple missing data points by comparing the mixed model to the widely used repeated measures ANOVA using an experimental set of data.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Drugs prescribed for psychiatric disorders in adolescence should be studied very extensively since they can affect developing and thus highly plastic brain differently than they affect~the adult brain. Therefore, we aimed to summarize animal studies reporting the behavioral consequences of chronic exposure to the most widely prescribed antidepressant drug among adolescents i.e., fluoxetine.                                         Methods               Electronic databases (Medline via Pubmed, Web of Science Core Collection, ScienceDirect) were systematically searched until April 12, 2022, for published, peer-reviewed, controlled trials concerning the effects of chronic fluoxetine administration vs. vehicle on anxiety and depression measures in naïve and stress-exposed adolescent rodents. All of the relevant studies were selected and critically appraised, and a meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed.                                         Results               A total of 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In naïve animals, chronic adolescent fluoxetine administration showed dose-related anxiogenic-like effects, measured as a reduction in time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. No significant effects of chronic adolescent fluoxetine on depression-like behavior were reported in naïve animals, while in stress-exposed rodents chronic adolescent fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility time in the forced swim test compared to vehicle.                                         Conclusions               These results suggest that although chronic fluoxetine treatment proves positive effects in animal models of depression, it may simultaneously increase anxiety in adolescent animals in a dose-related manner. Although the clinical implications of the data should be interpreted with extreme caution, adolescent patients under fluoxetine treatment should be closely monitored.},

  abstract = {Programmed cell death is an important mechanism during brain development in order to control neuronal cell numbers and to correctly form neuronal circuitries. Programmed cell death is also present in neurogenic regions of the adult brain, and a significant portion of the adult-born cells is eliminated during the first months of maturation. We here address the question whether overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 would improve the survival of neural progenitor cells and, as a consequence, increase neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Transgenic animals, which express human Bcl-2 under the neuron-specific enolase promoter (NSE-huBcl-2), show a significant reduction of apoptotic cells in the hippocampal granule cell layer to about half of the wildtype level. These apoptotic cells are almost exclusively found in the zone of hippocampal progenitor activity and frequently co-label with the neuronal progenitor marker doublecortin (DCX). The rate of adult neurogenesis is doubled in the dentate gyrus of Bcl-2overexpressing mice as demonstrated by quantification of progenitor cells using DCX and new neurons using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) ⁄ neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN) double-labelling. The effect of Bcl-2 is limited to the late phase of progenitor maturation, as proliferation and early-phase progenitor cells were not affected. The increased level of neurogenesis leads to a significantly higher total number of granule cells in the dentate gyrus. These results underline the importance of developmental cell death during neurogenesis in the adult brain.},

  abstract = {Housing conditions represent an important environmental variable playing a critical role in the assessment of mouse behaviour. In the present study the effects of isolation and nesting material on the behaviour of female C57BL/6J mice were evaluated. The mice were subjected to different rearing conditions from weaning (at the age of 3 weeks). The study groups were group- and single-housed mice, divided further into groups with or without nesting material (species-specific enrichment). After 8 weeks spent in respective conditions the behavioural testing began. Both factors (social conditions and nesting material) appeared to have a significant impact on the behavioural phenotype. However, it is important to stress that the interaction between the factors was virtually absent. We established that isolation increased locomotor activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviour in several tests of exploration. In contrast, absence of nesting material increased anxiety-like behaviour. Neither factor affected rota-rod performance, nociception and prepulse inhibition. Contextual fear memory was significantly reduced in single-housed mice, and interestingly, in mice with nesting material. Cued fear memory was reduced by single-housing, but not affected by enrichment. Mice from enriched cages displayed faster and better learning and spatial search strategy in the water maze. In contrast, isolation caused significant impairment in the water maze. In conclusion, both isolation and species-specific enrichment have profound effects on mouse behaviour and should be considered in design of the experiments and in assessment of animal welfare issues. © 2011 Kulesskaya et al.},

  abstract = {Rationale: N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play crucial roles in learning and memory, but the role of each NMDA receptor subtype in a specific cognitive process is unclear. Non-selective blockers of NMDA receptor are used to model the cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Counter-intuitively selective NR2A and 2B NMDA receptor antagonists are thought to have pro-cognitive properties. These seemingly contrasting findings might in part be the result of different compounds and behavioral measures used across studies. Objective: We compared the effect of NVP-AAM077 (NR2A antagonist), CP 101-606 (NR2B antagonist), and MK-801 (non-selective antagonist) in a series of touch screen tasks that can be used to measure spatial cognition and cognitive flexibility. Methods: NVP-AAM077, CP 101-606, and MK-801 were administered prior to testing, in adult male Lister-hooded rats trained in tasks of location discrimination, paired associate learning (PAL), and trial unique non-match to location (TUNL). Results: Results showed that MK-801 impaired performance on all the tasks. In contrast, CP 101-606 only impaired reversal learning in location discrimination and had minimal effect on working memory in TUNL and caused a modest improvement in accuracy in PAL and acquisition of a spatial discrimination. NVP-AAM077 had little effect on performance across tasks, although these data allude to a potential enhancement of acquisition of a spatial location and impairments in spatial reversal learning in a separation-dependent manner. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that non-selective NMDA antagonism will disrupt numerous aspects of cognitive function. However, selective antagonism is capable of impairing or enhancing cognitive function in a task-dependent fashion.},

The authors also review and discuss current key studies (pro and con) on adult neurogenesis in humans and animals, as well as research challenges with potential solutions. Finally, the authors discuss the clinical implications of adult neurogenesis in humans, based on what we know so far, including its potential use as a drug target in the development of pharmacological treatments for various neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress is thought to impart risk for depression via alterations in brain structure and function, but contributions of specific mediators in generating these changes remain unclear. We test the hypothesis that stress-induced increases in corticosterone (CORT), the primary rodent glucocorticoid, are the key mediator of stress-induced depressive-like behavioral changes and synaptic dysfunction in the rat hippocampus. In rats, we correlated changes in cognitive and affective behavioral tasks (spatial memory consolidation, anhedonia, and neohypophagia) with impaired excitatory strength at temporoammonic-CA1 (TA-CA1) synapses, an archetypical stress-sensitive excitatory synapse. We tested whether elevated CORT was sufficient and necessary to generate a depressive-like behavioral phenotype and decreased excitatory signaling observed at TA-CA1 after chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Chronic CORT administration induced an anhedonia-like behavioral state and neohypophagic behavior. Like CUS, chronic, but not acute, CORT generated an impaired synaptic phenotype characterized by reduced α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-preferring glutamate receptor-mediated excitation at TA-CA1 synapses, decreased AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 1 protein expression, and altered serotonin-1B receptor-mediated potentiation. Repeatedly blunting stress-induced increases of CORT during CUS with the CORT synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (MET) prevented these stress-induced neurobehavioral changes. MET also prevented the CUS-induced impairment of spatial memory consolidation. We conclude that corticosterone is sufficient and necessary to mediate glutamatergic dysfunction underlying stress-induced synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. Our results indicate that chronic excessive glucocorticoids cause specific synaptic deficits in the hippocampus, a major center for cognitive and emotional processing, that accompany stress-induced behavioral dysfunction. Maintaining excitatory strength at stress-sensitive synapses at key loci throughout corticomesolimbic reward circuitry appears critical for maintaining normal cognitive and emotional behavior.},

The biological mechanisms underpinning these dynamics remain elusive, particularly concerning how shifts in the composition of memory-encoding neuronal ensembles influence the evolution of a memory over time. By targeting developmentally distinct subpopulations of principal neurons, we discovered that memory encoding resulted in the concurrent establishment of multiple memory traces in the mouse hippocampus. Two of these traces were instantiated in subpopulations of early- and late-born neurons and followed distinct reactivation trajectories after encoding. The divergent recruitment of these subpopulations underpinned gradual reorganization of memory ensembles and modulated memory persistence and plasticity across multiple learning episodes. Thus, our findings reveal profound and intricate relationships between ensemble dynamics and the progression of memories over time.},

Recent work has documented specific cognitive deficits after elimination of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents, suggesting that these neurons may contribute to information processing in hippocampal circuits. Young adult-born neurons exhibit enhanced excitability and have altered capacity for synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slice preparations in vitro. Still, little is known about the effect of adult-born granule cells on hippocampal activity in vivo. To assess the impact of these new neurons on neural circuits in the dentate, we recorded perforant-path evoked responses and spontaneous network activity from the dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthetized mice whose hippocampus had been focally X-irradiated to eliminate the population of young adult-born granule cells. After X-irradiation, perforant-path responses were reduced in magnitude. In contrast, there was a marked increase in the amplitude of spontaneous γ-frequency bursts in the dentate gyrus and hilus, as well as increased synchronization of dentate neuron firing to these bursts. A similar increase in gamma burst amplitude was also found in animals in which adult neurogenesis was eliminated using the GFAP:TK pharmacogenetic ablation technique. These data suggest that young neurons may inhibit or destabilize recurrent network activity in the dentate and hilus. This unexpected result yields a new perspective on how a modest number of young adult-generated granule cells may modulate activity in the larger population of mature granule cells, rather than acting solely as independent encoding units.},

A significant problem, however, is the lack of consensus on how these representations are encoded and stored in memory. Specifically, the nature of egocentric and allocentric frames of reference in human memory is widely debated. Yet, in recent investigations of the spatial domain across the lifespan, these distinctions in mnemonic spatial frames of reference have identified age-related impairments.

  abstract = {Chronic-stress-induced depression is recognized as a widespread public health concern. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been the most common treatment for this illness. However, the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes in stress-induced depression remains unclear. Evidence from Animal studies has reported a variety of results regarding the effects of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on serotonin signaling pathways and 5-HT receptor subtypes. This divergence may rely on differences in protocols, methods, and studied pathways. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to weigh the currently available findings regarding serotonin receptor changes in animal models of CUMS. Overall, our meta-analysis results showed the association of altered expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the frontal cortex and 5-HT2A receptors both in the whole cortex and the hypothalamus of rats following CUMS. Moreover, by using a qualitative-structured analysis and the application of risk-of-bias tools, we identified possible sources of data variation between the studied literature, which should be taken into account in future animal studies of chronic-stress induced depression.},

Animal research has illuminated these neural systems and defined their reflex outputs. Although motivated behavior is more complex and varied in humans, the simpler underlying response patterns persist in affective expression. These basic phenomena are elucidated here in the context of affective perception. Thus, the research examines human beings watching uniquely human stimuli - primarily picture media (but also words and sounds) that prompt emotional arousal - showing how the underlying motivational structure is apparent in the organization of visceral and behavioral responses, in the priming of simple reflexes, and in the reentrant processing of these symbolic representations in the sensory cortex. Implications of the work for understanding pathological emotional states are discussed, emphasizing research on psychopathy and the anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {Animal models have been used extensively to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, and their treatment. However, the aetiology and pathophysiology of many such disorders are largely unknown, which makes validation of animal models particularly challenging. Furthermore, many diagnostic symptoms are difficult to define, operationalise and quantify, especially in experimental animals such as rats. Thus, rather than attempting to model complex human syndromes such as depression in their entirety, it can be more productive to define and model components of the illness that may account for clusters of co-varying symptoms, and that may share common underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In preclinical investigations of the neural regulatory mechanisms linking stress to depression and anxiety disorders, as well as the mechanisms by which chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs may exert their beneficial effects in these conditions, we have employed a number of behavioural tests in rats to model specific cognitive and anxiety-like components of depression and anxiety disorders. In the present study, we review the procedures for conducting four such behavioural assays: the attentional set-shifting test, the elevated-plus maze, the social interaction test and the shock-probe defensive burying test. The purpose is to serve as a guide to the utility and limitations of these tools, and as an aid in optimising their use and productivity. © 2008 The Authors.

  abstract = {Comparative medicine deals with similarities and differences between veterinary and human medicine. All mammals share most basic cellular and molecular mechanisms, thus justifying murine animal models in a translational perspective; yet “mice are not men,” thus some biases can emerge when complex biological processes are concerned. Brain plasticity is a cutting-edge, expanding topic in the field of Neurosciences with important translational implications, yet, with remarkable differences among mammals, as emerging from comparative studies. In particular, adult neurogenesis (the genesis of new neurons from brain stem cell niches) is a life-long process in laboratory rodents but a vestigial, mostly postnatal remnant in humans and dolphins. Another form of “whole cell” plasticity consisting of a population of “immature” neurons which are generated prenatally but continue to express markers of immaturity during adulthood has gained interest more recently, as a reservoir of young neurons in the adult brain. The distribution of the immature neurons also seems quite heterogeneous among different animal species, being confined within the paleocortex in rodents while extending into neocortex in other mammals. A recent study carried out in sheep, definitely showed that gyrencephalic, large-sized brains do host higher amounts of immature neurons, also involving subcortical, white, and gray matter regions. Hence, “whole cell” plasticity such as adult neurogenesis and immature neurons are biological processes which, as a whole, cannot be studied exclusively in laboratory rodents, but require investigation in comparative medicine, involving large-sized, long-living mammals, in order to gain insights for translational purposes.},

PCPA specifically retarded the onset of neuronal differentiation in brain regions known to contain 5-HT terminals or to have a high 5-HT content in the adult (5-HT target cells). Conversely, the 'stress' of daily vehicle injections accelerated onset of differentiation in these regions, possibly due to stimulation of 5-HT synthesis by glucocorticoids. These data support the model of 5-HT as a humoral signal for the differentiation of cells later recognized by 5-HT neurons as appropriate targets for synaptogenesis.},

After the policy was in place, the rate of data sharing increased by more than 50\%. We further looked at whether papers published under the open data policy were reproducible, in the sense that the published results should be possible to regenerate given the data, and given the code, when code was provided. For 8 out of the 59 papers, data sets were inaccessible. The reproducibility rate ranged from 34\% to 56\%, depending on the reproducibility criteria. The strongest predictor of whether an attempt to reproduce would be successful is the presence of the analysis code: it increases the probability of reproducing reported results by almost 40\%. We propose two simple steps that can increase the reproducibility of published papers: share the analysis code, and attempt to reproduce one’s own analysis using only the shared materials.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. The treatment of choice that shows good efficacy in mood stabilization is based on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Their primary mechanism of action is considered to be the increased synaptic concentration of serotonin through blockade of the serotonin transporter (SERT). In this study, we described an alternative mode of action of fluoxetine (FLX), which is a representative member of the SSRI class of antidepressants. We observed that FLX robustly decreases both glutamatergic and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synaptic release in a SERT-independent manner. Moreover, we showed that this effect may stem from the ability of FLX to change the levels of main components of the SNARE (solubile N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex. Our data suggest that this downregulation of SNARE fusion machinery involves diminished activity of protein kinase C (PKC) due to FLX-induced blockade of P/Q type of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Taken together, by virtue of its inhibition at SERT, fluoxetine increases extracellular serotonin levels; however, at the same time, by reducing SNARE complex function, this antidepressant reduces glutamate and GABA release.},

While this is not common, there are a number of advantages of such an approach, including greater statistical power due to increased precision, a simpler and more informative interpretation of the results, greater parsimony, and transformation of the predictor variable is possible. RESULTS: An example is given from an experiment where rats were randomly assigned to receive either 0, 60, 180, or 240 mg/L of fluoxetine in their drinking water, with performance on the forced swim test as the outcome measure. Dose was treated as either a categorical or continuous variable during analysis, with the latter analysis leading to a more powerful test (p = 0.021 vs. p = 0.159). This will be true in general, and the reasons for this are discussed. CONCLUSION: There are many advantages to treating variables as continuous numeric variables if the data allow this, and this should be employed more often in experimental biology. Failure to use the optimal analysis runs the risk of missing significant effects or relationships.},

This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating levels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also influence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not directly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on behaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in behavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown) neurogenesis-independent mechanisms were not formally taken into consideration during the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships and were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation is via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms.

  abstract = {Few studies that examine the neurogenesis–behaviour relationship formally establish covariation between neurogenesis and behaviour or rule out competing explanations. The behavioural relevance of neurogenesis might therefore be overestimated if other mechanisms account for some, or even all, of the experimental effects. A systematic review of the literature was conducted and the data reanalysed using causal mediation analysis, which can estimate the behavioural contribution of new hippocampal neurons separately from other mechanisms that might be operating. Results from eleven eligible individual studies were then combined in a meta-analysis to increase precision (representing data from 215 animals) and showed that neurogenesis made a negligible contribution to behaviour (standarised effect = 0.15; 95\% CI = −0.04 to 0.34; p = 0.128); other mechanisms accounted for the majority of experimental effects (standardised effect = 1.06; 95\% CI = 0.74 to 1.38; p = 1.7×10−11).},

  abstract = {The field of neuroscience has, after a long period of looking the other way, again embraced emotion as an important research area. Much of the progress has come from studies of fear, and especially fear conditioning. This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as “affect,” “hedonic tone,” or “emotional feelings,” and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this foundation into broader aspects of mind and behavior},

These processing modalities can be represented as attractor states using a dynamical systems model of the brain. The transition probability to move from one attractor state to another is dependent on the stability, depth, neuromodulatory tone, and tonic changes in plasticity. However, how does the relationship between these states change in disease states, such as anxiety or depression? We describe bottom-up and top-down processing from Marr's computational-algorithmic-implementation perspective to understand depressive and anxious disease states. We illustrate examples of bottom-up processing as basolateral amygdala signaling and projections and top-down processing as medial prefrontal cortex internal signaling and projections. Understanding these internal processing dynamics can help us better model the multifaceted elements of anxiety and depression.},

The reconsolidation phase has been seized upon as crucial for the understanding of memory stability and, more recently, as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of disorders such as post-traumatic stress and drug addiction. However, little is known about the reactivation process, or what might be the adaptive function of retrieval-induced plasticity. Reconsolidation has long been proposed to mediate memory updating, but only recently has this hypothesis been supported experimentally. Here, the adaptive function of memory reconsolidation is explored in more detail, with a strong emphasis on its role in updating memories to maintain their relevance.},

Among them, only in the 10mg/kg MPH-treated group, the numbers of BrdU(+), DCX(+) and BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells were significantly increased compared to those in the vehicle-treated group. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level was significantly increased in 10mg/kg MPH-treated group, not in the other experimental groups, compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results indicate that MPH, not ATX, can enhance cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the SGZ of the DG via increasing BDNF level.},

The reviewed evidence suggests that the hippocampus undergoes protracted functional and structural development after birth, and that this development is best understood in terms of cytoarchitectural and anterior–posterior functional subdivisions. The dentate gyrus may develop later than cornu ammonis 1 or the subiculum, and over development there may also be a shift towards recruiting the anterior hippocampus. Both of these changes promise new insights into the development of episodic memory and other cognitive functions, and indicate that the integration of the cytoarchitectural and anterior–posterior axes of development are necessary to address outstanding questions about the significance of hippocampal development from infancy into adulthood.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) are performed several times on the mean of experimental conditions. When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by α inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

To determine the distinguishable features of two-representative animal models of stress-induced depressive disorder, we compared isolation stress (IS) and unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). After 4-week of stress, both models showed significant depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in an open field test (OFT; p {$<$} 0.01 for IS, p {$<$} 0.01 for UCMS), forced swimming test (FST; p {$<$} 0.01 for IS, p {$<$} 0.01 for UCMS), and tail suspension test (TST; p {$<$} 0.01 for IS, p {$<$} 0.05 for UCMS) along with alterations in serum corticosterone levels, serotonin activity in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) and microglial activity in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (p {$<$} 0.05 for both parameters). In a comparison of the two stress models, IS strongly induced depressive and anxiety features, as indicated by all parameters: behavior test scores (p {$<$} 0.05 for OFT, FST, and TST), serum corticosterone levels (p {$<$} 0.05), immunohistological alterations for serotonin activity (p {$<$} 0.05) and microglial activity (p = 0.072). Our results indicate the suitability of IS for the development of animal models of depressive disorders and may reveal the medical impact of social isolation environment in modern society.},

The present study compares the influence of three different forms of enrichment in breeding cages on infant survival rate and development of C57BL/6J mice. Our data reveal that lack of enrichment results in greater preweaning pup mortality, reduced weight and delayed development. Changing the environmental conditions after birth cannot prevent litter loss but improves the development of pups born in impoverished environments. Overall, our results underline the importance of early counting of mice for optimizing refinement strategies to ensure well-being and breeding success.},

Results showed substantial differences between BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J strains. C57BL/6J mice had high baseline activity and exploration of a new environment, suggesting a low level of anxiety. BALB/cByJ mice displayed defensive and protective behavior, with limited exploration of the new environment together with low locomotor activity. The response to diazepam was also different for each strain: C57BL/6J mice showed higher sensitivity to diazepam treatment than did BALB/cByJ mice.},

Here, we present evidence that neurons in the rat cortex must undergo a "tagging process" upon encoding to ensure the progressive hippocampal-driven rewiring of cortical networks that support remote memory storage. This process was AMPA- and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent, information-specific, and capable of modulating remote memory persistence by affecting the temporal dynamics of hippocampal-cortical interactions. Post-learning reinforcement of the tagging process via time-limited epigenetic modifications resulted in improved remote memory retrieval. Thus, early tagging of cortical networks is a crucial neurobiological process for remote memory formation whose functional properties fit the requirements imposed by the extended time scale of systems-level memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus are regulated by many intrinsic and extrinsic cues. It is well accepted that elevated glucocorticoid levels lead to downregulation of adult neurogenesis, which this review discusses as one reason why psychiatric diseases, such as major depression, develop after long-term stress exposure. In reverse, adult neurogenesis has been suggested to protect against stress-induced major depression, and hence, could serve as a resilience mechanism. In this review, we will summarize current knowledge about the functional relation of adult neurogenesis and stress in health and disease. A special focus will lie on the mechanisms underlying the cascades of events from prolonged high glucocorticoid concentrations to reduced numbers of newborn neurons. In addition to neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor dysregulation, these mechanisms include immunomodulatory pathways, as well as microbiota changes influencing the gut-brain axis. Finally, we discuss recent findings delineating the role of adult neurogenesis in stress resilience.},

It has been criticized on many grounds, and yet a majority of textbook authors have ignored these criticisms in their discussions of the SPE, thereby misleading both students and the general public about the study's questionable scientific validity. Data collected from a thorough investigation of the SPE archives and interviews with 15 of the participants in the experiment further question the study's scientific merit. These data are not only supportive of previous criticisms of the SPE, such as the presence of demand characteristics, but provide new criticisms of the SPE based on heretofore unknown information. These new criticisms include the biased and incomplete collection of data, the extent to which the SPE drew on a prison experiment devised and conducted by students in one of Zimbardo's classes 3 months earlier, the fact that the guards received precise instructions regarding the treatment of the prisoners, the fact that the guards were not told they were subjects, and the fact that participants were almost never completely immersed by the situation. Possible explanations of the inaccurate textbook portrayal and general misperception of the SPE's scientific validity over the past 5 decades, in spite of its flaws and shortcomings, are discussed.

  abstract = {Background Understanding the structural connectivity of key brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical regions is essential to the development of therapeutic neuromodulation for depression, chronic pain, addiction, anxiety and movement disorders. Several brainstem nuclei have been identified as the primary central nervous system (CNS) source of important monoaminergic ascending fibers including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. However, due to practical challenges to their study, there is limited data regarding their in vivo anatomic connectivity in humans. Objective To evaluate the structural connectivity of the following brainstem nuclei with limbic cortical areas: locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, to develop a group average atlas of these limbic brainstem structures to facilitate future analyses. Methods Each nucleus was manually masked from 197 Human Connectome Project (HCP) structural MRI images using FSL software. Probabilistic tractography was performed using FSL’s FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox. Connectivity with limbic cortical regions was calculated and compared between brainstem nuclei. Results were aggregated to produce a freely available MNI structural atlas of limbic brainstem structures. Results A general trend was observed for a high probability of connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus and DLPFC with relatively lower connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and insula. The locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius demonstrated significantly greater connectivity to the DLPFC than amygdala while the periaqueductal grey, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area did not demonstrate a significant difference between these two structures. Conclusion Monoaminergic and other modulatory nuclei in the brainstem project widely to cortical limbic regions. We describe the structural connectivity across the several key brainstem nuclei theorized to influence emotion, reward, and cognitive functions. An increased understanding of the anatomic basis of the brainstem’s role in emotion and other reward-related processing will support targeted neuromodulatary therapies aimed at alleviating the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the leading global causes of disability. Symptoms of MDD can vary person to person, and current treatments often fail to alleviate the poor quality of life that patients experience. One of the two core diagnostic criteria for MDD is the loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities, which suggests a link between the disease aetiology and reward processing. Cognitive impairments are also common in patients with MDD, and more recently, emotional processing deficits known as affective biases have been recognised as a key feature of the disorder. Studies in animals have found similar affective biases related to reward. In this review we consider these affective biases in the context of other reward-related deficits and examine how affective biases associated with learning and memory may interact with the wider behavioural symptoms seen in MDD. We discuss recent developments in how analogues of affective biases and other aspects of reward processing can be assessed in rodents, as well as how these behaviours are influenced in models of MDD. We subsequently discuss evidence for the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to one or more reward-related deficits in preclinical models of MDD, identified using these behavioural assays. We consider how the relationships between these selective behavioural assays and the neurobiological mechanisms for affective bias and reward processing could be used to identify potential treatment strategies.},

We investigated the development of direction selectivity in ferret visual cortex using optical imaging and electrophysiological techniques and found an exception to this view. Unlike orientation selectivity and ocular dominance, direction selectivity was not detected at eye opening. Direction selectivity emerged several days later and strengthened to adult levels over the following 2 weeks. Visual experience was essential for this process, as shown by the absence of direction selectivity in dark-reared ferrets. The impairment persisted in dark-reared ferrets that were given experience after this period, despite the recovery of response amplitude, preference and bandwidth for stimulus orientation, spatial and temporal frequency, and contrast. Visual experience in early postnatal life plays a necessary and unique role in the development of cortical direction selectivity.},

The purpose of the present study was to investigate effects and possible mechanisms of a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure on cognitive behaviors in Swiss albino mice using the object recognition test (ORT) and object location test (OLT). Results showed that CMS exposure impaired cognitive performance and produced amnesia of acquired information in both ORT and OLT. Furthermore, the cognitive impairment was coexistent with increased plasma levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), as well as with enhanced plasma levels of corticosterone (CORT), corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). In addition, severe neuronal cell damage was found, as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells and the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus were decreased after 5~weeks CMS procedure. Taken together, these findings indicated that CMS exposure-induced impairment of cognitive behaviors might be attributed to the stress-related alterations in brain homeostasis that were reflected in changes in the neuroimmune and neuroendocrine systems as well as in neurogenesis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Much research has indicated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signal transduction pathway is involved in the pathophysiological mechanism of depression. But as to the question of which MAPKs are more relevant to stress effects, there is no definite answer. In the present study, 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and control groups, with 16 rats in each group. The CUS rats were exposed to 21-day chronic unpredictable stressors, and the controls were stress-free. After stress, 16 rats (8 in each group) were tested for spatial memory using Morris Water Maze, and 16 rats (8 from each group) were decapitated for detection of the three most extensively studied subgroups of MAPKs, ERK1/2, JNK and P38, and CREB in the hippocampus. The results showed that there was no statistical difference in the body weight between the two groups. The CUS rats showed impaired spatial memory in MWM. Western blot of hippocampus showed that CUS significantly decreased pCREB and pJNK levels, but there was no statistical difference between two groups in CREB, ERK1/2, pERK1/2, P38, pP38 and JNK levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that the reduced pCREB occurred in the dentate gyrus, not in the hippocampus proper. In conclusion, this study highlights that the JNK-CREB pathway, not the P38-CREB or ERK1/2-CREB pathway, in the hippocampus played an important role in the 21-day-CUS, and that the impaired spatial memory acquisition in the CUS rats can be restored to the level comparable to the pre-stressed state. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that there are significant changes in the gut microbiota (GM) of humans with depression and animal models of depression and chronic stress. In our present study, we determined whether an alteration in GM is a decisive factor in anxiety-like and depression-like behavior and its impact on brain neurochemistry. An antibiotic cocktail was used to deplete the GM of mice before they were colonized, via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), by the GM of control mice or mice that had been exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS donors). The CUMS-donor group of mice and the mice that were colonized by their microbiota (the CUMS-recipient group) both showed higher levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. The GM community of the CUMS-donor and CUMS-recipient was distinctively different from the controls, with the CUMS group characterized by a lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus and a higher relative abundance of Akkermansia. Interestingly, FMT affected both behavior and neuroinflammation. Mice given the CUMS microbiota had significant elevations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus, which were accompanied by upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that GM modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus through dysfunctional microbiota–gut–brain axis, exacerbating anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes.Key Points Chronic unpredictable mild stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in mice. Mice colonized with gut microbiota (GM) from stressed mice showed similar behaviors. The GM composition of the donor and recipient mice was also comparable. Their relative pattern of two bacteria has been tied to neuroinflammatory activity. The results suggest a link between GM, brain function, and anxiety and depression.},

The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory after 10 d of withdrawal. The level of BDNF in serum and the hippocampus were measured by ELISA. Results: The number of platform crossings and residence time in the target platform quadrant were significantly reduced in ketamine 3 d and 14 d groups than in the saline controls (both p {$<$} 0.05). In addition, the average escape latency of ketamine 3 d and 14 d groups were significantly longer than that of the saline 3 d and 14 d groups (p {$<$} 0.0001), respectively. Further examination found that only serum samples from ketamine 14 d group showed significantly decreased BDNF level compared to that from saline 14 d groups (p {$<$} 0.05). However, no differences were detected in hippocampus samples. Conclusion: Chronic ketamine exposure (25 mg/kg) causes spatial learning and memory deficits in SD rats, which may be associated with decreased serum BDNF levels.},

  abstract = {Running exercise has been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms, but the mechanism of its antidepressant effect is still unclear. Astrocytes are the predominant cell type in the brain and perform key functions vital to central nervous system (CNS) physiology. Mounting evidence suggests that changes in astrocyte number in the hippocampus are closely associated with depression. However, the effects of running exercise on astrocytes in the hippocampus of depression have not been investigated. Here, adult male rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 5 weeks followed by treadmill running for 6 weeks. The sucrose preference test (SPT) was used to assess anhedonia of rats. Then, immunohistochemistry and modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astrocytes in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to quantify the density of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+ and GFAP+ cells in each hippocampal subregion. We found that running exercise alleviated CUS-induced deficit in sucrose preference and hippocampal volume decline, and that CUS intervention significantly reduced the number of GFAP+ cells and the density of BrdU+/GFAP+ cells in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus (DG), while 6 weeks of running exercise reversed these decreases. These results further confirmed that running exercise alleviates depressive symptoms and protects hippocampal astrocytes in depressed rats. These findings suggested that the positive effects of running exercise on astrocytes and the generation of new astrocytes in the hippocampus might be important structural bases for the antidepressant effects of running exercise.},

  abstract = {Although an increasing number of articles examining statistical control variables exist, the use of control variables receives less scrutiny than other methodological topics, and research has yet to show how adding or dropping a control variable can damage causal inferences. By showing the unexpected consequences of including and excluding a control variable, this article challenges the view that additional control variables always strengthens causal conclusions. This study first illustrates the purification role of statistical control variables, and then quantifies the omitted variable bias. Using the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG), this essay differentiates confounding bias from overcontrol and endogenous selection bias. While using control variables may at times rule out alternative explanations, it is equally possible that adding control variables introduces overcontrol and endogenous selection biases, creating alternative interpretations rather than ruling them out. This paper concludes by discussing how and whether scholars should include certain control variables.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) can not only lead to depression-like behavior but also change the composition of the gut microbiome.  Regulating the gut microbiome can have an antidepressant effect, but the  mechanism by which it improves depressive symptoms is not clear. Short-chain  fatty acids (SCFAs) are small molecular compounds produced by the fermentation of  non-digestible carbohydrates. SFCAs are ubiquitous in intestinal endocrine and  immune cells, making them important mediators of gut microbiome-regulated body  functions. The balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory microglia plays an  important role in the occurrence and treatment of depression caused by chronic  stress. Non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin can regulate the structure of the gut  microbiome. We hypothesized that rifaximin protects against stress-induced  inflammation and depression-like behaviors by regulating the abundance of fecal  microbial metabolites and the microglial functions. METHODS: We administered  150~mg/kg rifaximin intragastrically to rats exposed to CUMS for 4~weeks and  investigated the composition of the fecal microbiome, the content of short-chain  fatty acids in the serum and brain, the functional profiles of microglia and  hippocampal neurogenesis. RESULTS: Our results show that rifaximin ameliorated  depressive-like behavior induced by CUMS, as reflected by sucrose preference, the  open field test and the Morris water maze. Rifaximin increased the relative  abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which were significantly  positively correlated with the high level of butyrate in the brain. Rifaximin  increased the content of anti-inflammatory factors released by microglia, and  prevented the neurogenic abnormalities caused by CUMS. CONCLUSIONS: These results  suggest that rifaximin can regulate the inflammatory function of microglia and  play a protective role in pubertal neurodevelopment during CUMS by regulating the  gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids.},

  abstract = {Mental disorders are characterized by high incidence and high recurrence rates, and only part of patients responded to drug medication. In this case, substantial preclinical investigations are needed. Most antipsychotics taken daily orally in clinics are administered through injection, oral gavage, or minipum implant in rodents, which may induce stress and affect the results of behavioral tests. How drug administrations on behaviors and drug efficacy remains an unsolved problem. In this study, we compared the intraperitoneal injection (IP), intragastric administration (IG), and tail vein injection (TVI) on behaviors, as well as the difference between administration-induced stress and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Next, we studied the effects of IG on CUMS model and drug efficacy. We found that IP, IG, and TVI, especially IG, induced a behavior-like phenotype of depression and anxiety, which we call the “CUMS-like behaviors”. However, such behaviors were not equal to depression. When treated CUMS mice with saline by gavage, they didn't show any aggravated phenotype compared with CUMS alone. We observed that fluoxetine by intraperitoneal injection was more effective than intragastric administration. Our study confirmed that repeated administrations lead to CUMS-like behaviors. Although these behaviors are not depression, they have adverse effects on drug efficacy.},

  abstract = {Adult neurogenesis endows the hippocampus with unparalleled neural plasticity, essential for intricate cognitive functions. However, the manner in which sparse newborn neurons (NBNs) modulate neural activities and subsequently shape behavior remains enigmatic. Utilizing a newly engineered NBN-Tetanus Toxin mouse model, we non-invasively silenced NBNs and confirmed their crucial role in cognitive flexibility, as demonstrated through reversal learning in the Morris water maze and the Go/Nogo task in operant learning. Pairing task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) with operant learning revealed a dorsal hippocampal hyperactivation during Nogo task, implying that hippocampal hyperexcitability might underlie the observed behavioral deficits. Notably, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) revealed enhanced functional connectivity between the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus following NBN silencing. Further exploration of PV+ interneurons and mossy cells’ activities highlighted NBN’s integral part in preserving the excitation/inhibition balance within the hippocampus. Our findings emphasize how the neural plasticity driven by NBNs extensively modulates the hippocampus, sculpting cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract = {Anxiety is a pervasive emotional response that can profoundly impact well-being and cognitive function in both humans and animals. The relationship between anxiety and aging remains complex and multifaceted. To explore this relationship in more detail, an open-field photobeam system was used to quantify anxiety-related behaviors in aging CB6F1 and C57BL/6 male mice and to determine associations with aging phenotypes, including short- and long-term memory, grip strength, rotarod performance, and self-motivated wheel running. Results indicated a heightened anxiety in novel environments with increasing age as evidenced by a preference for peripheral areas during the open-field test. Elevated anxiety levels were not associated with decreased cognitive performance, suggesting that anxiety and cognition operate somewhat independently of each other. A negative correlation was observed between anxiety levels and distance run in the voluntary wheel running assessment, while no associations were seen with grip strength or rotarod performance. These observations contribute to a better understanding of anxiety and its consequences in aging mice, providing insights into potential therapeutic interventions aimed at delaying aging through anxiety management.

To clarify the mechanism, rats were randomly divided into the control, chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)/standard and CUS/running groups. The rats in the CUS/running group ran for four weeks. In this study, a sucrose preference test (SPT) was used to evaluate the depression-like symptoms in the rats, and western blot, immunohistochemical and stereological analyses were performed to study the expression of synaptic-related proteins in the hippocampus and the changes in excitatory synapses in each sub-region. The results show that sucrose preference in the CUS/standard group was significantly lower than that in the control group, but in the CUS/running group, sucrose preference was higher than that in the CUS/standard group. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the synaptic-related proteins in the hippocampus among groups. The CUS/standard group exhibited fewer spinophilin+ (Sp+) dendritic spines representing excitatory synapses in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus than the control group, whereas the CUS/running group exhibited significantly more Sp+ dendritic spines in these regions than the CUS/standard group, indicating that excitatory synapses were reduced in depressed rats and that running exercises could reverse this change. We hypothesize that the changes in the number of excitatory synapses better reflect the changes in depressive symptoms than the level of synaptic proteins and that the effect of exercise on excitatory synapses in the sub-regions of the hippocampus may be an important structural indicator of the improvement of depressive symptoms.},

  abstract = {Depression, a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is commonly treated with antidepressants, electric shock and psychotherapy. Recently, increasing evidence has shown that exercise can effectively alleviate depression. To determine the difference in efficacy between exercise and the classic antidepressant fluoxetine in treating depression, we established four groups: the Control, chronic unpredictable stress (CUS/STD), running (CUS/RUN) and fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) groups. The sucrose preference test (SPT), the forced swimming test (FST), the tail suspension test (TST), immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and stereological analyses were used to clarify the difference in therapeutic efficacy and mechanism between exercise and fluoxetine in the treatment of depression. In the seventh week, the sucrose preference of the CUS/RUN group was significantly higher than that of the CUS/STD group, while the sucrose preference of the CUS/FLX group did not differ from that of the CUS/STD group until the eighth week. Exercise reduced the immobility time in the FST and TST, while fluoxetine only reduced immobility time in the TST. Hippocampal structure analysis showed that the CUS/STD group exhibited an increase in immature neurons and a decrease in mature neurons. Exercise reduced the number of immature neurons and increased the number of mature neurons, but no increase in the number of mature neurons was observed after fluoxetine treatment. In addition, both running and fluoxetine reversed the decrease in the number of MAP2+ dendrites in depressed mice. Exercise increased the number of spinophilin-positive (Sp+) dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions, whereas fluoxetine only increased the number of SP+ spines in the DG. In summary, exercise promoted newborn neuron maturation in the DG and regulated neuronal plasticity in three hippocampal subregions, which might explain why running exerts earlier and more comprehensive antidepressant effects than fluoxetine.},

A correct equilibrium between the human host and their microorganisms is important for an appropriate physiological function. Extensive research has shown that microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract-or gut microbiota- are involved not only in both nutritive and digestive activities but also in immunological processes. Moreover, the gut microbiome influences both central nervous system and energy homeostasis. An altered gut microbiome has been associated with the pathophysiology of different diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Apparently, both environmental-diet, exposition to antibiotics, and infections-and host-genetic factors have a strong influence on gut microbiome, modulating the risk for neuropsychiatric illness. Also, early life disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression later in life, suggesting a link between gut microbiome, neurodevelopment, and depression. This review aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the role played by the gut microbiome in neurodevelopment and in the etiology of the depressive syndrome, including nutritional, immunological, and energy homeostasis approaches.},

Spontaneous recovery restored the behavioral deficits in Barnes maze test, as well as the glutamate receptor expression changes.

It has been considered a stochastic event lacking genetic regulation, and pharmacological means to suppress neuronal necrosis are lacking. Using a Drosophila model of calcium overloading, we found JIL-1/mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1/2 is a regulator of neuronal necrosis through phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 28 (H3S28ph). Further, we identified its downstream events including displacement of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and activation of Trithorax (Trx). To test the role of JIL-1/PRC1/Trx cascade in mammals, we studied the necrosis induced by glutamate in rat cortical neuron cultures and rodent models of brain ischemia and found the cascade is activated in these conditions and inhibition of the cascade suppresses necrosis in vitro and in vivo. Together, our research demonstrates that neuronal necrosis is regulated by a chromatin-modifying cascade, and this discovery may provide potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for neuronal necrosis.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has an important role in ketamine-induced, rapid antidepressant effects despite the acute administration of fluoxetine not affecting mTOR phosphorylation in the brain. However, the effects of long-term fluoxetine treatment on mTOR modulation have not been assessed to date. In the present study, we examined whether fluoxetine, a type of commonly used antidepressant agent, alters mTOR signaling following chronic administration in different brain regions, including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. We also investigated whether fluoxetine enhanced synaptic protein levels in these regions via the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway and its downstream regulators, p70S6K and 4E-BP-1. The results indicated that chronic fluoxetine treatment attenuated the chronic, unpredictable, mild stress (CUMS)-induced mTOR phosphorylation reduction in the hippocampus and amygdala of mice but not in the frontal cortex or the hypothalamus. Moreover, the CUMS-decreased PSD-95 and synapsin I levels were reversed by fluoxetine, and these effects were blocked by rapamycin only in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings suggest that chronic treatment with fluoxetine can induce synaptic protein expression by activating the mTOR signaling pathway in a region-dependent manner and mainly in the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Anhedonia is the inability to experience pleasure from rewarding or enjoyable activities and is a core symptom of depression in humans. Here, we describe a protocol for the measurement of anhedonia in mice, in which anhedonia is measured by a sucrose preference test (SPT) based on a two-bottle choice paradigm. A reduction in the sucrose preference ratio in experimental relative to control mice is indicative of anhedonia. To date, inconsistent and variable results have been reported following the use of the SPT by different groups, probably due to the use of different protocols and equipment. In this protocol, we describe how to set up a clearly defined apparatus for SPT and provide a detailed protocol to ensure greater consistency when carrying out SPT. This optimized protocol is highly sensitive, reliable, and adaptable for evaluation of chronic stress–related anhedonia, as well as morphine-induced dependence. The whole SPT, including adaptation, baseline measurement, and testing, takes 8 d.},

Nevertheless, the reasons for AS's success remain unclear. In this article, we revisit AS by analyzing its technical details, implementation codes, and replays. We also propose the open-sourced mini-scaled AS's new versions to do ablation studies. We classify SC2 problems by difficulty level and suggest a research path for tackling them. We then identify several limitations of AS, such as its lack of strategic view, reasoning, scouting, changes in tactics, and planning. Our article also presents the first analysis of AS's replays. In conclusion, we emphasize that there is still a long way to solve the final SC2 problem.},

We develop environment-specific auxiliary tasks and examine factors affecting their usefulness. We suggest that the most beneficial tasks are potentially more biologically feasible for real agents to use. Lastly, we explore the development of internal representations in the activations of artificial agent neural networks.

Whether this circuit takes place only in mature granule neurons or, on the contrary, whether immature granule neurons also contribute to this novel connection is unknown. We used various retroviral vectors to show that immature granule neurons send axonal processes to and establish synaptic contacts with CA2 pyramidal neurons and that axonal growth follows a similar time course to that described for CA3 innervation. In addition, we provide experimental evidence demonstrating that the pathway connecting newborn granule neurons and the CA2 field can be modulated by physiological and deleterious stimuli.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

  abstract = {In the adult hippocampus new neurons are continuously generated throughout life and integrate into the existing network via the formation of thousands of new synapses. Adult-born granule cells are known to improve learning and memory at about 3-6 weeks post mitosis by enhancing the brains ability to discriminate similar memory items. However, the underlying mechanisms are still controversial. Here we review the distinct functional properties of the newborn young neurons, including enhanced excitability, reduced GABAergic inhibition, NMDA-receptor dependent electrogenesis and enhanced synaptic plasticity. Although these cellular properties provide a competitive advantage for synapse formation, they do not generate 'hyperactivity' of young neurons. By contrast, in vivo evidence from immediate early gene expression and calcium imaging indicates that young neurons show sparse activity during learning. Similarly, in vitro data show a low number of high-impact synapses, leading to activation young cells by distinct subsets of afferent fibers with minimal overlap. Overall, the enhanced excitability of young cells does not generate hyperactivity but rather counterbalance the low number of excitatory input synapses. Finally, sparse coding in young neurons has been shown to be crucial for neurogenesis-dependent improvement of learning behavior. Taken together, converging evidence from cell physiology and behavioral studies suggests a mechanism that can explain the beneficial effects of adult neurogenesis on brain function.},

Here, we combined functional imaging, retroviral and chemogenetic approaches in rats to tag and manipulate different populations of rat adult-born neurons.

However, only specific silencing of the adult-born neurons immature during learning impairs remote memory retrieval-induced reconsolidation.

  abstract = {One very promising hypothesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) pathogenesis is the gut-brain axis (GBA) dysfunction, which can lead to subclinical inflammation, hypothalamic–pituitary (HPA) axis dysregulation, and altered neural, metabolic and endocrine pathways. One of the most important parts of GBA is gut microbiota, which was shown to regulate different functions in the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this scoping review was to present the current state of research on the relationship between MDD and gut microbiota and extract causal relationships. Further, we presented the relationship between the use of probiotics and antidepressants, and the microbiota changes. We evaluated the data from 27 studies aimed to investigate microbial fingerprints associated with depression phenotype. We abstracted data from 16 and 11 observational and clinical studies, respectively; the latter was divided into trials evaluating the effects of psychiatric treatment (n = 3) and probiotic intervention (n = 9) on the microbiome composition and function. In total, the data of 1187 individuals from observational studies were assessed. In clinical studies, there were 490 individuals analysed. In probiotic studies, 220 and 218 patients with MDD received the intervention and non-active study comparator, respectively. It was concluded that in MDD, the microbiota is altered. Although the mechanism of this relationship is unknown, we hypothesise that the taxonomic changes observed in patients with MDD are associated with bacterial proinflammatory activity, reduced Schort Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) production, impaired intestinal barrier integrity and neurotransmitter production, impaired carbohydrates, tryptophane and glutamate metabolic pathways. However, only in few publications this effect was confirmed by metagenomic, metabolomic analysis, or by assessment of immunological parameters or intestinal permeability markers. Future research requires standardisation process starting from patient selection, material collection, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. We did not observe whether antidepressive medications influence on gut microbiota, but the use of psychobiotics in patients with MDD has great prospects; however, this procedure requires also standardisation and thorough mechanistic research. The microbiota should be treated as an environmental element, which considers the aetiopathogenesis of the disease and provides new possibilities for monitoring and treating patients with MDD.},

NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related to schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that prior long-term potentiation (LTP) occluded the increase of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway induced by MK-801, a non-competitive NMDAr antagonist. However, it is not clear whether LTP could also modulate aberrant oscillations and short-term plasticity disruptions induced by NMDAr antagonists. Thus, we tested whether LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.},

  abstract = {Stress is considered to be a causal agent of chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and Alzheimer's. Chronic glucocorticoid and catecholamine release into the circulation during the stress response has been suggested to activate damage mechanisms, which in the long term produce metabolic alterations associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. However, the consequences of stress in animal models for periods longer than 40 days have not been explored. The goal of this work was to determine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) produced alterations in the redox state and the inflammatory profile of rats after 20, 40, and 60 days. CUMS consisted of random exposure of the animals to different stressors. The following activities were measured in the liver and pancreas: reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and protein oxidation. Similarly, serum cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10) were determined. CUMS activated the stress response from day 20 until day 60. In the liver and pancreas, GHS levels were decreased from day 40, whereas protein lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were increased. This is the first work to report that the pancreas redox state is subject to chronic stress conditions. The TAC was constant in the liver and reduced in the pancreas. An increase in the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 inflammatory markers and a decrease in the IL-10 level due to CUMS was shown, thereby resulting in the generation of a systemic inflammation state after 60 days of treatment. Together, the CUMS consequences on day 60 suggest that both processes can contribute to the development of chronic degenerative diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. CUMS is an animal model that in addition to avoiding habituation activates damage mechanisms such as oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation, which allows the study of physio-pathological stress aspects over prolonged time periods of at least 60 days.},

  abstract = {The 1950s saw the clinical introduction of the first two specifically antidepressant drugs: iproniazid, a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor that had been used in the treatment of tuberculosis, and imipramine, the first drug in the tricyclic antidepressant family. Iproniazid and imipramine made two fundamental contributions to the development of psychiatry: one of a social-health nature, consisting in an authentic change in the psychiatric care of depressive patients; and the other of a purely pharmacological nature, since these agents have constituted an indispensable research tool for neurobiology and psychopharmacology, permitting, among other things, the postulation of the first aetiopathogenic hypotheses of depressive disorders. The clinical introduction of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the late 1980s, once again revolutionized therapy for depression, opening the way for new families of antidepressants. The present work reviews, from a historical perspective, the entire process that led to the discovery of these drugs, as well as their contribution to the development of the neuroscientific disciplines. However, all of these antidepressants, like the rest of those currently available for clinical practice, share the same action mechanism, which involves the modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission at a synaptic level, so that the future of antidepressant therapy would seem to revolve around the search for extraneuronal non-aminergic mechanisms or mechanisms that modulate the intraneuronal biochemical pathways.},

  abstract = {Infantile amnesia, the inability to form long-lasting episodic memories, is a phenomenon extensively known but with no clear understanding of its origins. However, a recent study showed that high rates of hippocampal postnatal neurogenesis degrade episodic-like memories in infants a few days after memory acquisition. Additionally, new studies indicate that exposure to an enriched environment in mice leads to high hippocampal neurogenesis in their offspring. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how this intergenerational trait affects the persistence of hippocampal memories. Therefore, we evaluated spatial memory retention in the offspring of enriched female mice after weaning to address this question. Ten days after spatial learning, we tested memory retention, observing that the offspring of enriched dams increased spatial memory failure; this finding correlates with high proliferation rates in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we evaluated the causal relationship between postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis and memory failure using the antiproliferative drug Temozolomide (TMZ), which rescued spatial memory retrieval. Finally, we evaluated neuronal activity in the hippocampus quantifying the cells expressing the immediate early gene c-Fos. This evaluation showed engram modifications between groups. This neural activity pattern indicates that the high neurogenesis rates can modify memory engrams and cognitive performance. In conclusion, the inherited increase of hippocampal neurogenesis by enriched dams leads to plastic changes that exacerbate infantile amnesia in a spatial task.},

  abstract = {Women are twice as likely to experience depression than men, yet until recently, preclinical studies in rodents have focused almost exclusively on males. As interest in sex differences and sex-specific mechanisms of stress susceptibility increases, chronic stress models for inducing depression-relevant behavioral and physiological changes in male rodents are being applied to females, and several new models have emerged to include both males and females, yet not all models have been systematically validated in females. An increasing number of researchers seek to include female rodents in their experimental designs, asking the question “what is the ideal chronic stress model for depression in females?” We review criteria for assessing female model validity in light of key research questions and the fundamental distinction between studying sex differences and studying both sexes. In overviewing current models, we explore challenges inherent to establishing an ideal female chronic stress model, with particular emphasis on the need for standardization and adoption of validated behavioral tests sensitive to stress effects in females. Taken together, these considerations will empower female chronic stress models to provide a better understanding of stress susceptibility and allow the development of efficient sex-specific treatments.},

  abstract = {Depressed suicide patients have elevated expression of neuronal tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) mRNA and protein in midbrain serotonergic neurons, as well as increases in brain serotonin turnover. The mechanisms underlying these changes are uncertain, but increased TPH2 expression and serotonin turnover could result from genetic influences, adverse early life experiences, or acute stressful life events, all of which can alter serotonergic neurotransmission and have been implicated in determining vulnerability to major depression. Emerging evidence suggests that there are several different stress-related subsets of serotonergic neurons, each with a unique role in the integrated stress response. Here we review our current understanding of how genetic and environmental factors may influence TPH2 mRNA expression and serotonergic neurotransmission, focusing in particular on the dorsomedial part of the dorsal raphe nucleus. This subdivision of the dorsal raphe nucleus is selectively innervated by key forebrain structures implicated in regulation of anxiety states, it gives rise to projections to a distributed neural system mediating anxiety states, and serotonergic neurons within this subdivision are selectively activated by a number of stress- and anxiety-related stimuli. A better understanding of the anatomical and functional properties of specific stress- or anxiety-related serotonergic systems should aid our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the etiology of anxiety and affective disorders.},

However, the abnormalities of neurotransmissions as well as intracellular signaling pathways affected by chronic stress in brain have not been fully explored. We investigated the effect of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on the emotional behaviors, dopaminergic and serotoninergic function, and intracellular signaling in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to CUMS for 4 weeks. CUMS was shown to induce hyperactivity in a novel environment, decrease interaction time in the social interaction test, prolong feeding latency in the novelty suppressed feeding test and enhance immobility in the forced swimming test. The levels of dopamine, its metabolites and turnover, and protein level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were increased by CUMS in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The level of serotonin and protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and TH were decreased by CUMS in the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Accompanying the increase in dopaminergic function, phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were increased by CUMS in the NAc. Administration of fluoxetine (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor: 20 mg/kg i.p.) and aripiprazole (dopamine D2 receptor partial agonist: 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) during CUMS, prevented behavioral changes and increase of dopamine level in the NAc. These data suggest that CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors are coupled with dopaminergic hyperfunction in the NAc and serotonergic hypofunction in the HPC and PFC.},

Neurexins also exemplify molecular diversity in the brain, with over a thousand alternatively spliced forms~and further structural heterogeneity contributed by heparan sulfate glycan modification. Yet, interactions between these modes of post-transcriptional and post-translational modification have not been studied. We reveal that these regulatory modes converge on neurexin-1 splice site 5 (S5): the S5 insert increases the number of heparan sulfate chains. This is associated with reduced neurexin-1 protein level and reduced glutamatergic neurotransmitter release. Exclusion of neurexin-1 S5 in mice boosts neurotransmission without altering the AMPA/NMDA ratio and shifts communication and repetitive behavior away from phenotypes associated with autism spectrum disorders. Thus, neurexin-1 S5 acts as a synaptic rheostat to impact behavior through the intersection of RNA processing and glycobiology. These findings position NRXN1 S5 as a potential therapeutic target to restore function in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress causes deleterious changes in physiological function in systems ranging from neural cells in culture to laboratory rodents, sub-human primates and humans. It is notable, however, that the vast majority of research in this area has been conducted in males. In this review, we provide information about chronic stress effects on cognition in female rodents and contrast it with responses in male rodents. In general, females show cognitive resilience to chronic stressors which impair male cognitive function using spatial tasks including the radial arm maze, radial arm water maze, Morris water maze, Y-maze and object placement. Moreover, stress often enhances female performance in some of these cognitive tasks. Memory in females is not affected by stress in non-spatial memory tasks like recognition memory and temporal order recognition memory while males show impaired memory following stress. We discuss possible bases for these sex-dependent differences including the use of different strategies by the sexes to solve cognitive tasks. Whether the sex differences result from changes in non-mnemonic factors is also considered. Sex-dependent differences in alcohol and drug influences on stress responses are also described. Finally, the role of neurally derived estradiol in driving sex differences and providing resilience to stress in females is shown. The importance of determining the nature and extent of sex differences in stress responses is that such differences may provide vital information for understanding why some stress related diseases have different incidence rates between the sexes and for developing novel therapeutic treatments.},

However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

In response to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) inputs, abGCs exert monosynaptic inhibition of mature granule cells (mGCs) through group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. By contrast, in response to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) inputs, abGCs directly excite mGCs through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Thus, a critical function of abGCs may be to regulate the relative synaptic strengths of LEC-driven contextual information versus MEC-driven spatial information to shape distinct neural representations in the DG.},

  abstract = {During stress there is activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, culminating in the production of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids can easily access the brain, where they bind to receptors and influence the brain and behaviour.Different outcomes result from exposure to stress at different periods of an individual's life.Exposure to stress in the prenatal period leads to programming effects, as evidenced by increased reactivity to stress later in life and reduced hippocampal volume in adulthood.Exposure to prenatal stress has been associated with learning impairments, enhanced sensitivity to drugs of abuse, and increases in anxiety and depression-related behaviours in adulthood.Maternal separation is a potent stressor in the postnatal period, and it leads to increased secretion of glucocorticoids that can extend into adulthood. By contrast, exposure to severe abuse during infancy is associated with lower levels of glucocorticoids in both primates and humans.Stress during adolescence has more important effects on the HPA axis than a similar stress exposure during adulthood. Moreover, the effects of stress during adolescence can incubate until adulthood, at which time they will become apparent.The effects of stress exposure on the brain and behaviour in adulthood are similar to those that are observed in childhood and adolescence. However, unlike these latter effects, the former effects are reversible; that is, they usually disappear after cessation of the stressor.In adulthood, chronic exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids has been associated with depressive disorder. By contrast, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder present lower levels of glucocorticoids.The effects of stress during aging are associated with both memory impairments and reduced hippocampal volumes.The life cycle model of stress explains why different disorders emerge in populations exposed to stress at different stages of their lives.},

With time, structural changes become apparent, which in general require the synthesis of new proteins. The investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these forms of synaptic plasticity has received much attention, because NMDA receptor–dependent LTP and LTD may constitute cellular substrates of learning and memory., Calcium influx through synaptic NMDA receptors triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). AMPA receptors are redistributed to either potentiate or weaken the synapse, and over time additional proteins are synthesized to maintain LTP or LTD.},

  abstract = {Atrophy of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression and related disorders. The ability to promote both structural and functional plasticity in the PFC has been hypothesized to underlie the fast-acting antidepressant properties of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine. Here, we report that, like ketamine, serotonergic psychedelics are capable of robustly increasing neuritogenesis and/or spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These changes in neuronal structure are accompanied by increased synapse number and function, as measured by fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology. The structural changes induced by psychedelics appear to result from stimulation of the TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A signaling pathways and could possibly explain the clinical effectiveness of these compounds. Our results underscore the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and, importantly, identify several lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts focused on developing plasticity-promoting compounds as safe, effective, and fast-acting treatments for depression and related disorders., Ly et al. demonstrate that psychedelic compounds such as LSD, DMT, and DOI increase dendritic arbor complexity, promote dendritic spine growth, and stimulate synapse formation. These cellular effects are similar to those produced by the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine and highlight the potential of psychedelics for treating depression and related disorders.,},

Physiol Rev 84: 87–136, 2004; 10.1152/physrev.00014.2003.—One of the most significant challenges in neuroscience is to identify the cellular and molecular processes that underlie learning and memory formation. The past decade has seen remarkable progress in understanding changes that accompany certain forms of acquisition and recall, particularly those forms which require activation of afferent pathways in the hippocampus. This progress can be attributed to a number of factors including well-characterized animal models, well-defined probes for analysis of cell signaling events and changes in gene transcription, and technology which has allowed gene knockout and overexpression in cells and animals. Of the several animal models used in identifying the changes which accompany plasticity in synaptic connections, long-term potentiation (LTP) has received most attention, and although it is not yet clear whether the changes that underlie maintenance of LTP also underlie memory consolidation, significant advances have been made in understanding cell signaling events that contribute to this form of synaptic plasticity. In this review, emphasis is focused on analysis of changes that occur after learning, especially spatial learning, and LTP and the value of assessing these changes in parallel is discussed. The effect of different stressors on spatial learning/memory and LTP is emphasized, and the review concludes with a brief analysis of the contribution of studies, in which transgenic animals were used, to the literature on memory/learning and LTP.},

On balance, however, the behavioral evidence does not seem to have supported O'Keefe and Nadel's original hypothesis that true spatial or locale learning is quite distinct from simple associative learning and depends on the establishment of a cognitive map of the environment.

Infantile amnesia is the term used to describe this phenomenon of accelerated forgetting during infancy, and it is not unique to humans. Over the years, information garnered from animal studies has provided clues as to the neurobiological basis of infantile amnesia. The purpose of this review is to provide a neurobiological update on what we now know about infantile amnesia since the publication of Campbell and Spear's seminal review on the topic more than 40 years ago. We present evidence that infantile amnesia is unlikely to be explained by a unitary theory, with the protracted development of multiple brain regions and neurotransmitter systems important for learning and memory likely to be involved. The recent discovery that exposure to early life stress can alleviate infantile amnesia offers a potential explanation as to how early adversity can so profoundly affect mental health in adulthood, and understanding the neurobiological basis for this early transition may lead to the development of effective therapeutic interventions.},

While contemporary tracking software provides precise positional information of mice for the duration of the probe test, existing performance measures (e.g., percent quadrant time, platform crossings) fail to exploit fully the richness of this positional data. Using the concept of entropy (H), here we develop a new measure that considers both how focused the search is and the degree to which searching is centered on the former platform location. To evaluate how H performs compared to existing measures of water maze performance we compiled five separate databases, containing more than 1600 mouse probe tests. Random selection of individual trials from respective databases then allowed us to simulate experiments with varying sample and effect sizes. Using this Monte Carlo-based method, we found that H outperformed existing measures in its ability to detect group differences over a range of sample or effect sizes. Additionally, we validated the new measure using three models of experimentally induced hippocampal dysfunction: (1) complete hippocampal lesions, (2) genetic deletion of alphaCaMKII, a gene implicated in hippocampal behavioral and synaptic plasticity, and (3) a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Together, these data indicate that H offers greater sensitivity than existing measures, most likely because it exploits the richness of the precise positional information of the mouse throughout the probe test.},

In the water maze, mice or rats are trained to navigate to a platform located below the water's surface. Spatial learning is then typically assessed in a probe test, where the platform is removed from the pool and the mouse or rat is allowed to search for it. Performance in the probe test may then be evaluated using either occupancy-based (percent time in a virtual quadrant [Q] or zone [Z] centered on former platform location), error-based (mean proximity to former platform location [P]) or counting-based (platform crossings [X]) measures. While these measures differ in their popularity, whether they differ in their ability to detect group differences is not known. To address this question we compiled five separate databases, containing more than 1600 mouse probe tests.

  abstract = {The high symptomatic and biological heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) makes it very difficult to find broadly efficacious treatments that work against all symptoms. Concentrating on single core symptoms that are biologically well understood might consist of a more viable approach. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a trans-diagnostic dimensional approach that focuses on symptoms and their underlying neurobiology. Evidence is accumulating that psychedelics may possess antidepressant activity, and this can potentially be explained through a multi-level (psychobiological, circuitry, (sub)cellular and molecular) analysis of the cognitive systems RDoC domain. Cognitive deficits, such as negative emotional processing and negativity bias, often lead to depressive rumination. Psychedelics can increase long-term cognitive flexibility, leading to normalization of negativity bias and reduction in rumination. We propose a theoretical model that explains how psychedelics can reduce the negativity bias in depressed patients. At the psychobiological level, we hypothesize that the negativity bias in MDD is due to impaired pattern separation and that psychedelics such as psilocybin help in depression because they enhance pattern separation and hence reduce negativity bias. Pattern separation is a mnemonic process that relies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, where similar inputs are made more distinct, which is essential for optimal encoding of contextual information. Impairment in this process may underlie the negative cognitive bias in MDD by, for example, increased pattern separation of cues with a negative valence that can lead to excessive deliberation on aversive outcomes. On the (sub) cellular level, psychedelics stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis as well as synaptogenesis, spinogenesis and dendritogenesis in the prefrontal cortex. Together, these effects help restoring resilience to chronic stress and lead to modulation of the major connectivity hubs of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Based on these observations, we propose a new translational framework to guide the development of a novel generation of therapeutics to treat the cognitive symptoms in MDD.},

  abstract = {Recent research has investigated the potential of psychedelic substances in treating various neurological and psychiatric disorders. In particular, there has been a growth in studies concerning the intersection of psychedelics, Virtual Reality (VR), and Cognitive Flexibility (CF). Indeed, the use of immersive technology allows the simulation of the perceptual and cognitive effects of psychedelic substances without the potential risks associated with them. CF is strongly associated with creative cognition, a complex cognitive mechanism involved in creative thinking and associated with the prefrontal cortex and the neural networks supporting executive functions, memory, attention, and spontaneous modes of thought. The Bayesian brain approach, which is rooted in predictive coding, has emerged as a promising framework for understanding the effects of psychedelic hallucinations on cognitive functioning. Psychedelic substances may enhance creativity by inducing a state of CF, allowing for a wider range of associations and possibilities to be explored and increasing openness to experience. A decline in cognitive abilities, including creative processing and divergent thinking, is observed during the aging process. In particular, studies on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) show poorer performance in executive functions, including CF. The present paper suggests that psychedelic hallucinations induced by VR may help optimize the balance between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information. Therefore, enhanced CF and creativity may be crucial during the aging process for maintaining cognitive functions and preventing pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Western diets are high in fat and sucrose and can influence behavior and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence that altering the microbiome can influence the brain and behavior. This study was designed to determine whether diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota could contribute to alterations in anxiety, memory or cognitive flexibility. Two-month-old, male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned high-fat (42\% fat, 43\% carbohydrate (CHO), high-sucrose (12\% fat, 70\% CHO (primarily sucrose) or normal chow (13\% kcal fat, 62\% CHO) diets. Fecal microbiome analysis, step-down latency, novel object and novel location tasks were performed prior to and 2. weeks after diet change. Water maze testing for long- and short-term memory and cognitive flexibility was conducted during weeks 5-6 post-diet change. Some similarities in alterations in the microbiome were seen in both the high-fat and high-sucrose diets (e.g., increased Clostridiales), as compared to the normal diet, but the percentage decreases in Bacteroidales were greater in the high-sucrose diet mice. Lactobacillales was only significantly increased in the high-sucrose diet group and Erysipelotrichales was only significantly affected by the high-fat diet. The high-sucrose diet group was significantly impaired in early development of a spatial bias for long-term memory, short-term memory and reversal training, compared to mice on normal diet. An increased focus on the former platform position was seen in both high-sucrose and high-fat groups during the reversal probe trials. There was no significant effect of diet on step-down, exploration or novel recognitions. Higher percentages of Clostridiales and lower expression of Bacteroidales in high-energy diets were related to the poorer cognitive flexibility in the reversal trials. These results suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to cognitive changes associated with eating a Western diet.},

Here, we argue that in order to leverage this long-standing issue, traditional notions regarding the architecture of memory should be eschewed. Instead, we invoke the idea that scenes are central to hippocampal information processing. This view is motivated by mounting evidence that the hippocampus is constantly constructing spatially coherent scenes, automatically anticipating and synthesizing representations of the world beyond the immediate sensorium. By characterizing the precise relationship between scenes and the hippocampus, we believe a theoretically enriched understanding of its fundamental role and its breakdown in pathology can emerge.},

  abstract = {Chronic stressful life events are risk factors for developing major depression, the pathophysiology of which is strongly linked to impairments in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. Exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) has been found to induce depressive-like behaviours, including passive behavioural coping and anhedonia in animal models, along with many other affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. The heterogeneity of these symptoms represents the plurality of corticolimbic structures involved in mood regulation that are adversely affected in the disorder. Chronic stress has also been shown to negatively regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a phenomenon that is involved in antidepressant effects and regulates subsequent stress responses. Although there exists an enormous body of data on stress-induced alterations of 5-HT activity, there has not been extensive exploration of 5-HT adaptations occurring presynaptically or at the level of the raphe nuclei after exposure to CUS. Similarly, although hippocampal neurogenesis is known to be negatively regulated by stress and positively regulated by antidepressant treatment, the role of neurogenesis in mediating affective behaviour in the context of stress remains an active area of investigation. The goal of this review is to link the serotonergic and neurogenic hypotheses of depression and antidepressant effects in the context of stress. Specifically, chronic stress significantly attenuates 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and this effect could represent an endophenotypic hallmark for mood disorders. In addition, by decreasing neurogenesis, CUS decreases hippocampal inhibition of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, exacerbating stress axis overactivity. Similarly, we discuss the possibility that adult hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effects via the ventral (in rodents; anterior in humans) hippocampus’ influence on the HPA axis, and mechanisms by which antidepressants may reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT and neurogenic changes. Although data are as yet equivocal, antidepressant modulation of 5-HT neurotransmission may well serve as one of the factors that could drive neurogenesis-dependent antidepressant effects through these stress regulation-related mechanisms.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of antidepressants on hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a marker for dividing cells. Our studies demonstrate that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly increases the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus and hilus of the hippocampus. Administration of several different classes of antidepressant, but not non-antidepressant, agents was found to increase BrdU-labeled cell number, indicating that this is a common and selective action of antidepressants. In addition, upregulation of the number of BrdU-labeled cells is observed after chronic, but not acute, treatment, consistent with the time course for the therapeutic action of antidepressants. Additional studies demonstrated that antidepressant treatment increases the proliferation of hippocampal cells and that these new cells mature and become neurons, as determined by triple labeling for BrdU and neuronal- or glial-specific markers. These findings raise the possibility that increased cell proliferation and increased neuronal number may be a mechanism by which antidepressant treatment overcomes the stress-induced atrophy and loss of hippocampal neurons and may contribute to the therapeutic actions of antidepressant treatment.},

Observational and preclinical data have suggested it to be capable of producing both subjective and emotional effects on par with other classical psychedelics and entactogens. Whereas it is the most prevalently used novel serotonergic hallucinogen to date, it’s acute effects and distinctions from classical progenitors have yet to be characterised in a controlled study. We assessed for the first time the immediate acute subjective, cognitive, and cardiovascular effects of 2C-B (20 mg) in comparison to psilocybin (15mg) and placebo in a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 healthy psychedelic-experienced participants. 2C-B elicited alterations of waking consciousness of a psychedelic nature, with dysphoria, subjective impairment, auditory alterations, and affective elements of ego dissolution largest under psilocybin. Participants demonstrated equivalent psychomotor slowing and spatial memory impairments under either compound compared to placebo, as indexed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Tower of London (TOL) and Spatial Memory Task (SMT). Neither compound produced empathogenic effects on the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET). 2C-B induced transient pressor effects to a similar degree as psilocybin. The duration of self-reported effects of 2C-B was shorter than that of psilocybin, largely resolving within 6 hours. Present findings support the categorisation of 2C-B as a subjectively “lighter” psychedelic. Tailored dose-effect studies are needed to discern the pharmacokinetic dependency of 2C-B’s experiential overlaps.},

  abstract = {The stress response is multifactorial and enrolls circuitries to build a coordinated reaction, leading to behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic changes. These changes are mainly related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation and the organism’s integrity. However, when self-regulation is ineffective, stress becomes harmful and predisposes the organism to pathologies. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is a widely used experimental model since it induces physiological and behavioral changes and better mimics the stressors variability encountered in daily life. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glucocorticoid (GCs) are deeply implicated in the CUS-induced physiological and behavioral changes. Nonetheless, the CUS modulation of CRF receptors and GR and the norepinephrine role in extra-hypothalamic brain areas were not well explored. Here, we show that 14-days of CUS induced a long-lasting HPA axis hyperactivity evidenced by plasmatic corticosterone increase and adrenal gland hypertrophy, which was dependent on both GCs and NE release induced by each stress session. CUS also increased CRF2 mRNA expression and GR protein levels in fundamental brain structures related to HPA regulation and behavior, such as the lateral septal nucleus intermedia part (LSI), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). We also showed that NE participates in the CUS-induced increase in CRF2 and GR levels in the LSI, reinforcing the locus coeruleus (LC) involvement in the HPA axis modulation. Despite the CUS-induced molecular changes in essential areas related to anxiety-like behavior, this phenotype was not observed in CUS animals 24 h after the last stress session. HighlightsCUS persistently increased plasma CORT levels via GCs and NE signaling.CUS persistently increased CRF2 mRNA in extra-hypothalamic brain areas.CUS increased GR protein levels in brain regions related to GCs release control.NE and GCs participate in the CUS-induced increase in CRF2 and GR levels.LSI could be the brain nucleus that dictates the fine-tuned response of CUS.CUS animals did not present anxiety-like behavior.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Depressive disorders are the 4th leading cause of health problems and the 2nd leading cause of burden among all diseases. Almost all depressive disorder patients have cognitive impairments to a certain extend. Studies about cognitive impairments in depression had been conducted, but whether cognitive dysfunctions are the cause or the effect is still not clear. Objectives: To analyze the process of working memory and cognitive flexibility impairments in a rat model of depression. Methods: In this experimental study, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used as a model of depression in 30 rats (Rattus nover-gicus). Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze and attentional set shifting test. Results: This study found a significant difference on day 21 in working memory (p = 0.002) and cognitive flexibility (p = 0.036), which continued to day 41 in working memory (p = 0.001) and cogni-tive flexibility (p = 0.020). In the CUMS model of depression, parameters peak on day 41 and reveal parameter changes in weight gain (p = 0.018), food intake (p {$<$} 0.001), changes in food intake (p = 0.001), and the sucrose preference (p = 0.005), elevated plus maze (p = 0.001), and light dark box tests (p = 0.020). Conclusion: In a rat model of depression, cognitive impairment preceded depression, but it might be caused by anxiety-like behavior that occurred in early stimulation of chronic unpredictable mild stress.},

Finally, it is suggested that the onus of responsibility for choice between the two designs be placed on the individual investigator, with the decision being contingent upon the kinds of inferences he wishes to draw.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIt has been shown that ketamine can improve suicidality and depression. Evidence for other dimensions of psychopathology is lacking. We undertook a systematic review to investigate the effect of ketamine on cognition, anxiety, quality of life, and social functioning in adults with psychiatric disorders.MethodsPubMed (Medline), Scopus, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched up to April 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ketamine [or its S (+) enantiomer] reporting data on cognition, anxiety, quality of life, social functioning in adults with psychiatric disorders were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for summarizing continuous outcomes.ResultsTwenty-two reports were included in the final selection, of which 20, corresponding to 1,298 participants, were included in the quantitative synthesis. Affective disorders were the predominant diagnostic category. Median follow-up time was 21 days. The evidence was rated moderate to very low. In most trials, ketamine was administered intravenously or as adjuvant to electro-convulsant therapy (ECT). Only 2 trials of intranasal esketamine were identified. The effect of ketamine on depression was confirmed (SMD: −0.61 [95\% CI: −1.06; −0.16]). Furthermore, by pooling results of 6 RCTs, ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD: −0.42 [95\% CI: −0.84; 0.003]), particularly when administered not within ECT (5 trials; SMD: −0.58 [95\% CI: −1.07; −0.09]). However, there was moderate heterogeneity of results. Patients treated with ketamine also had an improvement in social functioning (SMD: −0.31 [95\% CI: −0.52; −0.10]), although the estimate was based only on 2 studies. No difference to comparators was found with respect to cognition and quality of life.ConclusionAlongside the antidepressant effect, ketamine may also improve anxiety and social functioning in adults with affective disorders.},

  abstract = {We examined the in¯uence of extensive overtraining (75 trials) of auditory fear conditioning on the expression of conditional stimulus (CS)-elicited spike ®ring in lateral amygdala (LA) neurons. Single units were recorded from chronic multichannel electrodes implanted in the LA of conscious and freely moving rats. In sequential training sessions, the rats received either ®ve or 70 fear conditioning trials, which consisted of a white-noise CS and a coterminating footshock unconditional stimulus (US). Unpaired (sensitization) controls received the same number of trials, but the CS and US were explicitly unpaired. Paired CS±US presentations yielded robust increases in CS-elicited spike ®ring in LA neurons after both ®ve and 70 conditioning trials, and the magnitude of the spike ®ring increases was correlated with the expression of conditional freezing to the CS. After 75 training trials, maximal conditioning-related increases in LA ®ring were exhibited within 20 ms of CS onset, indicating that this increase is mediated by direct thalamo-amygdala projections. There was no signi®cant increase in CS-elicited spike ®ring or freezing behaviour in the unpaired group. These results complement amygdala lesion studies [e.g. Maren, S. (1999a) J. Neurosci., 19, 8696±8703] and support the view that the basolateral complex of the amygdala is involved in the encoding and storage of fear memories even after extensive overtraining.},

Although adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory, the specific role of new GCs remains unclear. We examined whether immature adult-born neurons contribute to information encoding. By combining calcium imaging and electrophysiology in acute slices, we found that weak afferent activity recruits few mature GCs while activating a substantial proportion of the immature neurons. These different activation thresholds are dictated by an enhanced excitation/inhibition balance transiently expressed in immature GCs. Immature GCs exhibit low input specificity that switches with time toward a highly specific responsiveness. Therefore, activity patterns entering the dentate gyrus can undergo differential decoding by a heterogeneous population of GCs originated at different times.},

A lack of understanding of the exact neurobiological mechanisms of depression complicates the search for new effective drugs. Animal models are an important tool in the search for new approaches to the treatment of this disorder. All animal models of depression have certain advantages and disadvantages. We often hear that the main drawback of the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression is its poor reproducibility, but rarely does anyone try to find the real causes and sources of such poor reproducibility. Analyzing the articles available in the PubMed database, we tried to identify the factors that may be the sources of the poor reproducibility of CUMS. Among such factors, there may be chronic sleep deprivation, painful stressors, social stress, the difference in sex and age of animals, different stress susceptibility of different animal strains, handling quality, habituation to stressful factors, various combinations of physical and psychological stressors in the CUMS protocol, the influence of olfactory and auditory stimuli on animals, as well as the possible influence of various other factors that are rarely taken into account by researchers. We assume that careful inspection of these factors will increase the reproducibility of the CUMS model between laboratories and allow to make the interpretation of the obtained results and their comparison between laboratories to be more adequate.},

Since the introduction of monoclonal antibodies against BrdU, an increasing number of methodologies have been used for the immunodetection of this synthesized bromine-tagged base analogue into replicating DNA. BrdU labeling is widely used for identifying neuron precursors and following their fate during the embryonic, perinatal, and adult neurogenesis in a variety of vertebrate species including birds, reptiles, and mammals. Due to BrdU toxicity, its incorporation into replicating DNA presents adverse consequences on the generation, survival, and settled patterns of cells. This may lead to false results and misinterpretation in the identification of proliferative neuroblasts. In this review, I will indicate the detrimental effects of this nucleoside during the development of the central nervous system, as well as the reliability of BrdU labeling to detect proliferating neuroblasts. Moreover, it will show factors influencing BrdU immunodetection and the contribution of this nucleoside to the study of prenatal, perinatal, and adult neurogenesis. Human adult neurogenesis will also be discussed. It is my hope that this review serves as a reference for those researchers who focused on detecting cells that are in the synthetic phase of the cell cycle.},

Although it has the same evolutionary survival significance as aversive conditioning, appetitive conditioning has rarely been studied in humans. This gap may be explained by the difficulty to find in humans suitable appetitive stimuli that can elicit physiological responses similar to those elicited by aversive stimuli. To help remedy this gap, we review the literature on conditioning, with emphasis on appetitive conditioning. This review comprises three parts. First, we examine the different forms of conditioning. Second, we review the neural basis of appetitive conditioning, particularly from a functional neuroimaging perspective. And third, we demonstrate how perturbations in processes involved in appetitive conditioning can contribute to implicated psychopathologies and suggest neurobiological models underlying these pathologies. The ultimate goal of this review is to stimulate new avenues of research that have direct links to molecular biology, and thus could prove to be invaluable to progress in the understanding and treatment of psychiatric disabilities.},

  abstract = {Background Microbiome studies suggest the presence of an interaction between the human gut microbiome and soil-transmitted helminth. Upon deworming, a complex interaction between the anthelminthic drug, helminths and microbiome composition might occur. To dissect this, we analyse the changes that take place in the gut bacteria profiles in samples from a double blind placebo controlled trial conducted in an area endemic for soil transmitted helminths in Indonesia. Methods Either placebo or albendazole were given every three months for a period of one and a half years. Helminth infection was assessed before and at 3 months after the last treatment round. In 150 subjects, the bacteria were profiled using the 454 pyrosequencing. Statistical analysis was performed cross-sectionally at pre-treatment to assess the effect of infection, and at post-treatment to determine the effect of infection and treatment on microbiome composition using the Dirichlet-multinomial regression model. Results At a phylum level, at pre-treatment, no difference was seen in microbiome composition in terms of relative abundance between helminth-infected and uninfected subjects and at post-treatment, no differences were found in microbiome composition between albendazole and placebo group. However, in subjects who remained infected, there was a significant difference in the microbiome composition of those who had received albendazole and placebo. This difference was largely attributed to alteration of Bacteroidetes. Albendazole was more effective against Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms but not against Trichuris trichiura, thus in those who remained infected after receiving albendazole, the helminth composition was dominated by T. trichiura. Discussion We found that overall, albendazole does not affect the microbiome composition. However, there is an interaction between treatment and helminths as in subjects who received albendazole and remained infected there was a significant alteration in Bacteroidetes. This helminth-albendazole interaction needs to be studied further to fully grasp the complexity of the effect of deworming on the microbiome. Trial registration ISRCTN Registy, ISRCTN83830814.},

We found that suppressing the generation of new hippocampal neurons via treatment with temozolomide, an antiproliferation agent, impaired learning the location of a hidden platform in the water maze in juvenile mice (1–2 months old) but not in adult mice (2–3 months old) or middle-aged mice (11–12 months old). These findings suggest that during juvenility, suppression of neurogenesis may alter hippocampal development, whereas during adulthood and aging, pre-existing neurons may compensate for the lack of new hippocampal neurons. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Such contextual fear extinction involves the formation of a new memory that inhibits a previously acquired contextual fear memory. However, fear-related responses often return with the simple passage of time (spontaneous fear recovery). Given that contextual fear and extinction memories are hippocampus-dependent and hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to modify preexisting memories, we hypothesized that neurogenesis-mediated modification of preexisting extinction memory would modify spontaneous fear recovery. To test this, rats underwent contextual fear conditioning followed by extinction. Subsequently, we exposed rats to an enriched environment or focal X-irradiation to enhance or ablate hippocampal neurogenesis, respectively. Over a month later, rats were tested to evaluate spontaneous fear recovery. We found that enhancing neurogenesis after, but not before, extinction prevented fear recovery. In contrast, neurogenesis ablation after, but not before, extinction promoted fear recovery. Using the neuronal activity marker c-Fos, we identified brain regions recruited in these opposing neurogenesis-mediated changes during fear recovery. Together, our findings indicate that neurogenesis manipulation after extinction learning modifies fear recovery by recruiting brain network activity that mediates the expression of preexisting contextual fear and extinction memories.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus’s dentate gyrus is a critical structure for memory acquisition and emotional processing in the brain. This structure is unique as it is one of the areas with a higher density of excitatory neurons and contains some of the largest known axonic terminals. Those terminals form the unique synaptic structures known as thorny excrescences with the pyramidal neurons of the critical memory processing area, the third layer of the Cornu Ammonis (CA3). However, the most intriguing characteristic of the dentate gyrus is its continual addition of newborn neurons through the lifetime of most mammals, and there is substantial evidence that the same occurs in humans. The continuous addition of newborn cells confers the dentate gyrus with an extraordinary and unique source of plasticity. This feature facilitates cognitive flexibility, critical for the proper acquisition of new memories over old schemes. The failure of the dentate gyrus’ unique plasticity features can be critical to understanding the etiology of depression and the continuous fear relapse characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is compelling evidence that depression and PTSD onset rely on the decreased hippocampus and dentate gyrus- CA3 complex, and apparently, neurogenesis can be beneficial for the treatment of those ailments. This chapter aims to explain how the dentate gyrus circuits and their neurogenesis modulation can generate interesting insights to treat psychopathologies of emotional nature.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Hippocampal neurogenesis, the continuous creation of new neurons in the adult brain, influences memory, regulates the expression of defensive responses to threat (fear), and cognitive processes like pattern separation and behavioral flexibility. One hypothesis proposes that neurogenesis promotes cognitive flexibility by degrading established memories and promoting relearning. Yet, empirical evidence on its role in fear discrimination tasks is scarce. In this study, male rats were initially trained to differentiate between two similar environments, one associated with a threat. Subsequently, we enhanced neurogenesis through environmental enrichment and memantine treatments. We then reversed the emotional valence of these contexts. In both cases, neurogenesis improved the rats’ ability to relearn the aversive context. Interestingly, we observed increased hippocampal activity, and decreased activity in the prelimbic cortex and lateral habenula, while the infralimbic cortex remained unchanged, suggesting neurogenesis-induced plasticity changes in this brain network. Moreover, when we pharmacologically inhibited the increased neurogenesis with Methotrexate, rats struggled to relearn context discrimination, confirming the crucial role of neurogenesis in this cognitive process. Overall, our findings highlight neurogenesis’s capacity to facilitate changes in fear discrimination and emphasize the involvement of a prefrontal-hippocampal-habenula mechanism in this process. This study emphasizes the intricate relationship between hippocampal neurogenesis, cognitive flexibility, and the modulation of fear-related memories.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

CONCLUSIONS: These plots are preferred to represent continuous variables since they effectively describe the range, shape, and variability of observations and clearly identify outliers. By contrast, bar graphs address only measures of central tendency. Bar graphs should be used only to describe qualitative data.},

In preclinical studies, chronic treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) had antidepressant effects correlated with increased hippocampal cell proliferation in adult rodents. However, the contribution of the enantiomers of fluoxetine is largely unknown. We investigated the effects of treatment with (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine on cognitive behavioral paradigms and examined cell proliferation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J female mice. In a behavioral sequencing task using the IntelliCage system in which discriminated spatial patterns of rewarded and never-rewarded corners were reversed serially, (R)-fluoxetine-treated mice showed rapid acquisition of behavioral sequencing (compared with S-fluoxetine) and cognitive flexibility in subsequent reversal stages in intra- and inter-session analysis. (R)-fluoxetine also increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus, in particular in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus. (R)-fluoxetine had superior effects to (S)-fluoxetine in elevated plus maze, forced-swim and tail-suspension tests. These results suggest that (R)-fluoxetine, which has been reported to have a shorter half-life than (S)-fluoxetine, has superior antidepressant effects and more consistently improves spatial learning and memory. This profile offers advantages in depression treatment and may also aid management of the neurocognitive impairments associated with depression.},

However little is known about individual differences in how people experience reward in music-related activities. The goal of the present study was to describe the main facets of music experience that could explain the variance observed in how people experience reward associated with music. To this end we developed the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ), which was administrated to three large samples. Our results showed that the musical reward experience can be decomposed into five reliable factors: Musical Seeking, Emotion Evocation, Mood Regulation, Social Reward, and Sensory-Motor. These factors were correlated with socio-demographic factors and measures of general sensitivity to reward and hedonic experience. We propose that the five-factor structure of musical reward experience might be very relevant in the study of psychological and neural bases of emotion and pleasure associated to music.},

We investigated the role of dentate granule neurons (DGNs) born during adolescence in spatial memory and compared them with those generated earlier in life (in embryos or neonates) or during adulthood by combining functional imaging, retroviral and optogenetic tools to tag and silence DGNs. By imaging DGNs expressing Zif268, a proxy for neuronal activity, we found that neurons generated in adolescent rats (and not embryos or neonates) are transiently involved in spatial memory processing. In contrast, adult-generated DGNs are recruited at a later time point when animals are older. A causal relationship between the temporal origin of DGNs and spatial memory was confirmed by silencing DGNs in behaving animals. Our results demonstrate that the emergence of spatial memory depends on neurons born during adolescence, a function later assumed by neurons generated during adulthood.},

Despite~these advancements, it was not clear which statistical software is mainly used for which research design thereby creating confusion and uncertainty in choosing the right statistical tools. Therefore, this study aimed to review the trend of statistical software usage and their associated study designs in articles published in health sciences research., Methods, This bibliometric analysis study reviewed 10,596 articles published in PubMed in three 10-year intervals (1997, 2007, and 2017). The data were collected through Google sheet and were analyzed using SPSS software. This study described the trend and usage of currently available statistical tools and the different study designs that are associated with them., Results, Of the statistical software mentioned in the retrieved articles, SPSS was the most common statistical tool used (52.1\%) in the three-time periods followed by SAS (12.9\%) and Stata (12.6\%). WinBugs was the least used statistical software with only 40(0.6\%) of the total articles. SPSS was mostly associated with observational (61.1\%) and experimental (65.3\%) study designs. On the other hand, Review Manager (43.7\%) and Stata (38.3\%) were the most statistical software associated with systematic reviews and meta-analyses., Conclusion, In this study, SPSS was found to be the most widely used statistical software in the selected study periods.

However, growing evidence suggests that a core endogenous role is to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment, through behavioral inhibition and enhanced plasticity. We used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning using pharmacogenetics. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, and thus report signals similar to those proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing the cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons, we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Our findings show how the activity patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility, and suggest a revised model of dopamine–serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications.},

Distress is typically defined as unpleasant subjective stress responses such as anxiety and depression. It may be measured using a variety of general and context-linked scales. States of distress reflect psychobiological, cognitive, and social influences, but should be understood as the outcome of dynamic self-regulation as the person confronts external threats and pressures. Individuals differ considerably in their vulnerability to distress. Traits including neuroticism, dispositional anxiety, and metacognitive style increase vulnerability, whereas traits such as hardiness, grit, and emotional intelligence support resilience. Distress is associated with abnormalities in information-processing, including attentional impairment and cognitive bias. Distress is also a key symptom in a range of emotional disorders.},

  abstract = {Previous research has found that exposure to unpredictable stress can augment anxiety in humans and animals. The appearance of anxiety symptoms in humans frequently develop after stress exposure has terminated, but few rodent studies have systematically examined the delayed anxiogenic effects of unpredictable stress. Therefore, the current study investigated whether anxiety-like behaviors in rats would increase at several time intervals following exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Unconditioned and conditioned response tasks were used to assess anxiety in male rats 1, 7 or 14~days following exposure to 10~days of a variety of stressors. Rats exposed to CUS showed increased burying behaviors and immobility during the defensive burying test, a conditioned anxiety test. The effects on burying behavior were apparent 7 and 14~days after the termination of the unpredictable stress procedure, but not when tested 1~day after CUS. Total time immobile in the defensive burying test also increased 14~days after termination of the last stressor. In contrast, there were no significant effects of CUS on behavioral measures in the unconditioned response tasks, the elevated plus-maze or light-dark box, at any time point following exposure to CUS. The current findings suggest that CUS may be a useful model of human conditioned anxiety that develops subsequent to chronic stress exposure. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Ketamine, a drug introduced in the 1960s as an anesthetic agent and still used for that purpose, has garnered marked interest over the past two decades as an emerging treatment for major depressive disorder. With increasing evidence of its efficacy in treatment-resistant depression and its potential anti-suicidal action, a great deal of investigation has been conducted on elucidating ketamine’s effects on the brain. Of particular interest and therapeutic potential is the ability of ketamine to exert rapid antidepressant properties as early as several hours after administration. This is in stark contrast to the delayed effects observed with traditional antidepressants, often requiring several weeks of therapy for a clinical response. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have a unique mechanism of action involving glutamate modulation via actions at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and [Formula: see text]-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, as well as downstream activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways to potentiate synaptic plasticity. This paper provides a brief overview of ketamine with regard to pharmacology/pharmacokinetics, toxicology, the current state of clinical trials on depression, postulated antidepressant mechanisms and potential biomarkers (biochemical, inflammatory, metabolic, neuroimaging sleep-related and cognitive) for predicting response to and/or monitoring of therapeutic outcome with ketamine.},

However, the interpretation of results is often impaired by the common use of statistical tests based on independence and normal distributions that do not reflect basic properties of the test data, such as the constant-sum constraint. In this work, we propose to analyze MWM data with the Dirichlet distribution, which describes constant-sum data with minimal hypotheses, and we introduce a statistical test based on uniformity (equal amount of time spent in each quadrant of the maze) that evaluates memory impairments. We demonstrate that this test better represents MWM data and show its efficiency on simulated as well as  in vivo data. Based on Dirichlet distribution, we also propose a new way to plot MWM data, showing mean values and inter-individual variability at the same time, on an easily interpretable chart. Finally, we conclude with a perspective on using Bayesian analysis for MWM data.},

  abstract = {Given the relationship between sleep and depression, there is inevitably going to be an effect of antidepressants on sleep. Current evidence suggests that this effect depends on the class of antidepressant used and the dosage. The extent of variation between the effects of antidepressants and sleep may relate to their mechanism of action. This systematic review examines randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) that have reported the effect that antidepressants appear to have on sleep. RCTs are not restricted to depressed populations, since several studies provide useful information about the effects on sleep in other groups. Nevertheless, the distinction is made between those studies because the participant's health may influence the baseline sleep profiles and the effect of the antidepressant. Insomnia is often seen with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), with all tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) except amitriptyline, and all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with venlafaxine and moclobemide as well. Sedation has been reported with all TCAs except desipramine, with mirtazapine and nefazodone, the TCA-related maprotiline, trazodone and mianserin, and with all MAOIs. REM sleep suppression has been observed with all TCAs except trimipramine, but especially clomipramine, with all MAOIs and SSRIs and with venlafaxine, trazodone and bupropion. However, the effect on sleep varies between compounds within antidepressant classes, differences relating to the amount of sedative or alerting (insomnia) effects, changes to baseline sleep parameters, differences relating to REM sleep, and the degree of sleep-related side effects.

Many blame statistical significance tests themselves, and some regard them as sufficiently damaging to scientific practice as to warrant being abandoned. We take a contrary position, arguing that the central criticisms arise from misunderstanding and misusing the statistical tools, and that in fact the purported remedies themselves risk damaging science. We argue that banning the use of p-value thresholds in interpreting data does not diminish but rather exacerbates data-dredging and biasing selection effects. If an account cannot specify outcomes that will not be allowed to count as evidence for a claim—if all thresholds are abandoned—then there is no test of that claim. The contributions of this paper are: To explain the rival statistical philosophies underlying the ongoing controversy; To elucidate and reinterpret statistical significance tests, and explain how this reinterpretation ameliorates common misuses and misinterpretations; To argue why recent recommendations to replace, abandon, or retire statistical significance undermine a central function of statistics in science: to test whether observed patterns in the data are genuine or due to background variability.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the last 50 years many models of major depressive disorder have been developed on the basis of theoretical aspects of this disorder. These models and procedures have been crucial in the discovery and development of clinically-effective drugs. Notwithstanding, there is presently great concern about the discrepancy between positive outcomes of new candidate drugs in animal models and apparent lack of efficacy in humans i.e., the predictive validity of animal models. Some reasons for this concern lie in the over-reliance in the face value of behavioural models, design of clinical trials, placebo responses, genetic variations in response to drugs, species differences in bioavailability and toxicology, and not least, disinterest of pharmaceutical sponsors to continue developing certain drugs. Present model development is focusing on endophenotypic aspects of behaviours rather than trying to model whole syndromes. This essay traces the origins and theoretical bases of our animal models of depression or depressed-like behaviours in humans and indicates how they have evolved from behavioural assays used to measure the potency and efficacy of potential candidate drugs to tools by which endophenotypes of depression may be identified and verified pharmacologically. A cautionary note is included though to indicate that the true predictive validity of our models will not be fully assessed until we can determine the attrition rate of molecules discovered from new drug targets translating into clinically-effective drugs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These are typically analyzed using generalized linear models (GLMs), which can produce these quantities via nonlinear transformation of model parameters. Interactions are central within many research applications of these models. To date, typical practice in evaluating interactions for probabilities or counts extends directly from linear approaches, in which evidence of an interaction effect is supported by using the product term coefficient between variables of interest. However, unlike linear models, interaction effects in GLMs describing probabilities and counts are not equal to product terms between predictor variables. Instead, interactions may be functions of the predictors of a model, requiring nontraditional approaches for interpreting these effects accurately. Here, we define interactions as change in a marginal effect of one variable as a function of change in another variable, and describe the use of partial derivatives and discrete differences for quantifying these effects. Using guidelines and simulated examples, we then use these approaches to describe how interaction effects should be estimated and interpreted for GLMs on probability and count scales. We conclude with an example using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study demonstrating how to correctly evaluate interaction effects in a logistic model.},

The adult, as well as developing brain, possess a remarkable ability to show reversible structural and functional plasticity in response to stressful and other experiences, including neuronal replacement, dendritic remodeling, and synapse turnover. This is particularly evident in the hippocampus, where all three types of structural plasticity have been recognized and investigated, using a combination of morphological, molecular, pharmacological, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches. The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, brain regions involved in anxiety and fear, mood, cognitive function and behavioral control, also show structural plasticity. Acute and chronic stress cause an imbalance of neural circuitry subserving cognition, decision making, anxiety and mood that can increase or decrease expression of those behaviors and behavioral states. In the short term, such as for increased fearful vigilance and anxiety in a threatening environment, these changes may be adaptive; but, if the danger passes and the behavioral state persists along with the changes in neural circuitry, such maladaptation may need intervention with a combination of pharmacological and behavioral therapies, as is the case for chronic or mood anxiety disorders. We shall review cellular and molecular mechanisms, as well as recent work on individual differences in anxiety-like behavior and also developmental influences that bias how the brain responds to stressors. Finally, we suggest that such an approach needs to be extended to other brain areas that are also involved in anxiety and mood.

  abstract = {Exposure to chronic predictable stress, such as restraint, can affect performance on spatial memory tasks and these effects have been shown to be sex-specific in rats. It is not known whether unpredictable stress has similar sex-specific effects on spatial memory and whether those effects are present after the stress procedure has ended. Therefore, the current study tested male and female rats in the Morris water maze either immediately or 3. weeks following exposure to 10. days of unpredictable stress (CUS). Male and female rats were exposed to 10. days of stressors that varied by type and time of stressor application. Exposure to CUS decreased the distance swam to locate the hidden platform during acquisition training in the water maze for female but not male rats. Overall, male rats performed better than female rats during the acquisition, probe and matching to place trials. These effects were observed when assessing spatial memory performance immediately or 3. weeks following the last stressor. Plasma corticosterone levels followed the behavioral differences during the acquisition trials in that control female rats had increased basal and swim-stimulated corticosterone levels compared to CUS female rats and control male rats. These data demonstrate that unpredictable stress influences performance on the water maze in a sex-specific manner, which parallel plasma corticosterone levels. The improved performance of female rats following CUS exposure was present 3. weeks after the termination of the stress procedures, suggesting that stress may have lasting effects on underlying neural systems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Intriguingly, the DG also produces adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) throughout the lifespan, but their contribution to downstream firing dynamics remains unclear. Here, we show that abDGCs promote sparser hippocampal population spiking during mnemonic processing of novel stimuli. By combining triple-(DG-CA3-CA1) ensemble recordings and optogenetic interventions in behaving mice, we show that abDGCs constitute a subset of high-firing-rate neurons with enhanced activity responses to novelty and strong modulation by theta oscillations. Selectively activating abDGCs in their 4–7-week post-birth period increases sparsity of hippocampal population patterns, whereas suppressing abDGCs reduces this sparsity, increases principal cell firing rates and impairs novel object recognition with reduced dimensionality of the network firing structure, without affecting single-neuron spatial representations. We propose that adult-born granule cells transiently support sparser hippocampal population activity structure for higher-dimensional responses relevant to effective mnemonic information processing.},

  abstract = {Free-living animals rely on cognitive functions, such as learning and memory, for numerous aspects of their survival. However, research involving these mechanisms is often limited to the laboratory where animals are far removed from natural influences. Here, we adapted the Morris Water Maze (MWM) for use in the field to test learning and memory of free-living white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus. The MWM consists of a pool filled with opaque water and a platform that is hidden beneath the surface of the water. Mice were tasked with finding an escape platform using proximate-cue based spatial learning skills across trials within and between two tests. The two tests occurred 2 hrs apart and each consisted of 5 trials with a maximum search time of 60 s, separated by 15-s breaks. We found mice demonstrated rapid learning within the first 5 trials, as indicated by a faster time and reduced distanced swam to find the platform in trial 5 as compared to trial 1 in Test 1. We also found mice remembered the task, as indicated by equivalent performance (in time and distance) after the two-hour delay period (i.e., performance in Test 2 trial 1 was similar to that in Test 1 trial 5). Lastly, we found that there was no increase in performance as mice completed an additional 5 trials (i.e., no difference in Test 1 trial 5 vs. Test 2 trial 5). By assessing several variables that serve as standard metrics for learning and memory within the MWM, we were able to illustrate the ability of wild mice to successfully navigate within a modified version of an established learning/memory paradigm. This study is important for promoting more accessible forms of cognitive testing in free-living animals and use of such a method could provide insights into how animals cope with environmental stressors in their natural environment such as anthropogenic disturbance, invasive species, and habitat degradation. A better understanding of cognitive behavior in wild animals may help diminish the disparity of knowledge that is often present between laboratory and field research.},

In this review we provide an overview of how these two systems may interact. Excess levels of inflamma-tory mediators occur in a subgroup of depressed patients. Studies of acute experimental activation of the immune system with endotoxin and of chronic activation during interferon-a treatment show that inflammation can cause depression. Peripheral inflammation leads to microglial activation which could interfere with excitatory amino acid metabolism leading to inappropriate gluta-mate receptor activation. Loss of astroglia, a feature of depression, upsets the balance of anti-and pro-inflammatory mediators and further impairs the removal of excitatory amino acids. Microglia activated by excess inflammation, astroglial loss, and inappropriate glutamate receptor activation Needs Assessment Depression is a serious disorder for which available treatments are inadequate and the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood, Recent research has highlighted the potential role of excess inflammation and dysregulated glutamate neurotransmission in depression. The convergence of these two fields may reveal novel treatment targets. Learning Objectives At the end of this activity, the participant should be able to: • List inflammatory mediators commonly elevated in plasma in depression. • Understand the potential role of the kynurenine pathway in depression. • Enumerate two ways in which inflammatory mediators and glutamate interact. • Describe the specific role and interactions between microglia and astro-glia and how this may contribute to depression.

  abstract = {1. The component processes contributing to post-activation change in synaptic efficacy in the perforant pathway to the fascia dentata were studied in rats under sodium pentobarbitone anaesthesia., 2. With low stimulus strength, which activated only a relatively small number of perforant path fibres, repetitive stimulation led to effects which had very similar characteristics to those observed at neuromuscular synapses under similar conditions. Paired shocks resulted in a short (∼ 100 ms) facilitation superimposed on a depression, possibly due to depletion of available transmitter, which recovered more slowly (∼ 4 s). Short trains of stimuli at 125-250 Hz led to a longer lasting increase in synaptic strength which decayed to control levels with a double exponential time course. The two exponential components behaved like augmentation and potentiation at neuromuscular synapses, with time constants at 33 °C of about 5 s and about 90 s respectively., 3. High-intensity stimulus trains of identical frequency and duration led to an enhancement of synaptic strength which lasted for longer than 30 min., 4. The paired shock depletion effect was increased in direct proportion to the amount of augmentation and potentiation present following low-intensity stimulus trains. Following high-intensity trains the paired shock depletion effect was increased by the same amount, and recovered with the same time course as following low-intensity stimulus trains, even though there remained a significant enhancement of the synaptic response., 5. The results are interpreted as indicating that augmentation and potentiation are due to an increase in the probability of transmitter release whereas long-term enhancement acts through some other, as yet undetermined, mechanism. Following high-intensity stimulation all three processes are activated.},

  abstract = {Most commonly used behavioral measures for testing learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) involve comparisons of an animal's residence time in different quadrants of the pool. Such measures are limited in their ability to test different aspects of the animal's performance. Here, we describe novel measures of performance in the MWM that use vector fields to capture the motion of mice as well as their search pattern in the maze. Using these vector fields, we develop quantitative measures of performance that are intuitive and more sensitive than classical measures. First, we describe search patterns in terms of vector field properties and use these properties to define three metrics of spatial memory namely Spatial Accuracy, Uncertainty and, Intensity of Search. We demonstrate the usefulness of these measures using four different data sets including comparisons between different strains of mice, an analysis of two mouse models of Noonan syndrome (NS; Ptpn11 D61G and Ptpn11 N308D/+), and a study of goal reversal training. Importantly, besides highlighting novel aspects of performance in this widely used spatial task, our measures were able to uncover previously undetected differences, including in an animal model of NS, which we rescued with the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor SL327. Thus, our results show that our approach breaks down performance in the MWM into sensitive measurable independent components that highlight differences in spatial learning and memory in the MWM that were undetected by conventional measures.},

  abstract = {Brugmansia Pers, belonging to the family Solanaceae, is a group commonly known as Floripondio, Angel’s Trumpets and Tree Datura, names associated with the use or manner of the plant. It has high alkaloid content, particularly Scopolamine, which is often used for induced intoxication for criminal purposes, when used in conjunction with central nervous system depressants in a mixture known as “burundanga”. Its flowers are large and colorful; its fruits are similar to those of cocoa. These plants are always found in clearings, orchards and gardens, since it is considered legal. At least eight species are naturally available, distributed in Central America and especially in South America, but records for Colombia are comparatively few and of low coverage, indicating the need for a national and continental review on the composition, distribution and variability of this genus. Despite Brugmansia being famous for its composition of alkaloids, Scopolamine is commercially extracted from other species. It is necessary to review the uses of this group of species, which in some cases range from ornamental, medicinal with external use, as well as their connotations in shamanistic rituals and witchcraft. The review should involve ethnobotanical aspects regarding genetic changes of populations associated with its use, the environments where it grows, its dispersion and associated biota, as well as the review from the medical, pharmacological, biogeographical, socio-legal perspective.},

Here, pregnant female rats were used and their offspring were submitted to neonatal MD from post-natal day 1–10; after weaning the rats were submitted to EE. MD caused deficits on short and long-term aversive and recognition memory and on cognitive flexibility tested on reversed Morris Water Maze test. MD also promoted the decrease of hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) protein expression. The EE was able to protect against the cognitive deficits, avoiding the memory and the cognitive flexibility disrupting, and normalizing hippocampal BDNF expression of rats submitted to MD. These data confirms that MD promotes long-life memory deficits and demonstrates that MD causes cognitive flexibility disruption; the mechanisms seem involve the decrease of BDNF. We also demonstrate that EE, which improves BDNF, is able to avoid memory deficits and cognitive flexibility disrupts.},

  abstract = {Early life is a sensitive period, in which enhanced neural plasticity allows the developing brain to adapt to its environment. This plasticity can also be a risk factor in which maladaptive development can lead to long-lasting behavioral deficits. Here, we test how early-life exposure to the selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, affects motivation, and dopaminergic signaling in adulthood. We show for the first time that mice exposed to fluoxetine in the early postnatal period exhibit a reduction in effort-related motivation. These mice also show blunted responses to amphetamine and reduced dopaminergic activation in a sucrose reward task. Interestingly, we find that the reduction in motivation can be rescued in the adult by administering bupropion, a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant and a smoke cessation aid but not by fluoxetine. Taken together, our studies highlight the effects of early postnatal exposure of fluoxetine on motivation and demonstrate the involvement of the dopaminergic system in this process. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The developmental period is characterized by enhanced plasticity. During this period, environmental factors have the potential to lead to enduring behavioral changes. Here, we show that exposure to the SSRI fluoxetine during a restricted period in early life leads to a reduction in adult motivation. We further show that this reduction is associated with decreased dopaminergic responsivity. Finally, we show that motivational deficits induced by early-life fluoxetine exposure can be rescued by adult administration of bupropion but not by fluoxetine.},

  abstract = {This article expands upon my presentation to the panel on “The Radical Prescription for Change” at the 2017 ASA (American Statistical Association) symposium on A World Beyond \$p{$<$}0.05\$. It emphasizes that, to greatly enhance the reliability of—and hence public trust in—statistical and data scientific findings, we need to take a holistic approach. We need to lead by example, incentivize study quality, and inoculate future generations with profound appreciations for the world of uncertainty and the uncertainty world. The four “radical” proposals in the title—with all their inherent defects and trade-offs—are designed to provoke reactions and actions. First, research methodologies are trustworthy only if they deliver what they promise, even if this means that they have to be overly protective, a necessary trade-off for practicing quality-guaranteed statistics. This guiding principle may compel us to doubling variance in some situations, a strategy that also coincides with the call to raise the bar from \$p{$<$}0.05\$ to \$p{$<$}0.005\$ [3]. Second, teaching principled practicality or corner-cutting is a promising strategy to enhance the scientific community’s as well as the general public’s ability to spot—and hence to deter—flawed arguments or findings. A remarkable quick-and-dirty Bayes formula for rare events, which simply divides the prevalence by the sum of the prevalence and the false positive rate (or the total error rate), as featured by the popular radio show Car Talk, illustrates the effectiveness of this strategy. Third, it should be a routine mental exercise to put ourselves in the shoes of those who would be affected by our research finding, in order to combat the tendency of rushing to conclusions or overstating confidence in our findings. A pufferfish/selfish test can serve as an effective reminder, and can help to institute the mantra “Thou shalt not sell what thou refuseth to buy” as the most basic professional decency. Considering personal stakes in our statistical endeavors also points to the concept of behavioral statistics, in the spirit of behavioral economics. Fourth, the current mathematical education paradigm that puts “deterministic first, stochastic second” is likely responsible for the general difficulties with reasoning under uncertainty, a situation that can be improved by introducing the concept of histogram, or rather kidstogram, as early as the concept of counting.},

However, aggression in group-housed male mice under laboratory housing conditions is a well-known problem leading to serious health issues, including injury or death. Therefore, group-housed mice are frequently separated for welfare reasons. In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 different handling methods (tail, forceps, tube) in 2 different housing conditions (single vs. group) on the variance of aggression-associated parameters in male C57BL/6NCrl mice over 8 weeks. Blood glucose concentration, body weight, body temperature, plus number and severity of bite wounds and barbering intensity in group-housed mice were recorded. An assessment of nest complexity was also performed weekly. Feces were collected in week 3 and 7 for analysis of corticosterone metabolites. We also monitored the level of aggression by recording the behavior of group-housed animals after weekly cage cleaning. An open field test followed by a social novel object test, a light/dark box test, a hotplate and a resident-intruder test were performed at the end of the 8-week handling period. Post-mortem, we assessed organ weights. We found that forceps-handled mice, independent of the housing condition, had significantly higher levels of stress-induced-hyperthermia and enhanced aggression after cage cleaning, and they performed worse in the nest complexity test. In addition, handling male mice by the tail seems to be most effective to reduce aggressiveness after transferring animals into new cages, thereby representing an appropriate refinement.},

Volumetric MRI data were normalized for brain size. Results. The volume of the left hippocampus was significantly smaller in the patients compared with the controls. Both groups exhibited similar significant hippocampal asymmetry (left smaller than right). The patients, but not the controls, had significant asymmetry of the amygdalar volumes (right smaller than left). No differences were observed between the patients and controls in the T2 relaxation times for the hippocampus and amygdala.

The rapid growth in adoption of LMMs has been matched by a proliferation of differences in practice. Unless this diversity is recognized, and checked, the field shall reap enormous difficulties in the future when attempts are made to consolidate or synthesize research findings. Here we examine this diversity using two methods – a survey of researchers (n~=~163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n~=~400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors’ intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

  abstract = {Exercise has been recognized as a beneficial factor for cognitive health, particularly in relation to the hippocampus, a vital brain region responsible for learning and memory. Previous research has demonstrated that exercise-mediated improvement of learning and memory in humans and rodents correlates with increased adult neurogenesis and processes related to enhanced synaptic plasticity. Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. With the aim to further elucidate these mechanisms we provide a comprehensive dataset of the mouse hippocampal transcriptome at the single-cell level after four weeks of voluntary wheel-running. Our analysis provides a number of interesting observations. For example, the results suggest that exercise affects adult neurogenesis by accelerating the maturation of a subpopulation of Prdm16-expressing neurons. Moreover, we uncover the existence of an intricate crosstalk among multiple vital signaling pathways such as NF-κB, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, retinoic acid (RA) pathways altered upon exercise in a specific cluster of excitatory neurons within the Cornu Ammonis (CA) region of the hippocampus. In conclusion, our study provides an important resource dataset and sheds further light on the molecular changes induced by exercise in the hippocampus. These findings have implications for developing targeted interventions aimed at optimizing cognitive health and preventing age-related cognitive decline.},

Treatment options, although effective, are aimed at relieving the symptoms with limited disease modification. Ketamine, a commonly used anaesthetic, has received substantial attention as it shows rapid antidepressant effects clinically. We studied the effects of ketamine on hippocampal function and dentate gyrus proliferation in rats showing a depressive-like phenotype. Methods: Adolescent and adult animals were pre-natally exposed to the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone, and we verified a depressive-like phenotype using behavioural tests, such as the sucrose preference. We subsequently studied the effects of ketamine on hippocampal synaptic transmission, plasticity and dentate gyrus proliferation. In addition, we measured hippocampal glutamate receptor expression. We also tested the ketamine metabolite hydroxynorketamine for NMDA-receptor independent effects. Results: Surprisingly, our extensive experimental survey revealed limited effects of ketamine or its metabolite on hippocampal function in control as well as depressive-like animals. We found no effects on synaptic efficacy or induction of long-term potentiation in adolescent and adult animals. Also there was no difference when comparing the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Importantly, however, ketamine 24 hours prior to experimentation significantly increased the dentate gyrus proliferation, as revealed by Ki-67 immunostaining, in the depressive-like phenotype. Conclusion: We find limited effects of ketamine on hippocampal glutamatergic transmission. Instead, alterations in dentate gyrus proliferation could explain the antidepressant effects of ketamine.},

  abstract = {Studies of the World Health Organization suggest that in the year 2020, depressive disorder will be the illness with the highest burden of disease. Especially unipolar depression is the psychiatric disorder with the highest prevalence and incidence, it is cost-intensive and has a relatively high morbidity. Lately, the biological process involved in the aetiology of depression has been the focus of research. Since its emergence, the monoamine hypothesis has been adjusted and extended considerably. An increasing body of evidence points to alterations not only in brain function, but also in neuronal plasticity. The clinical presentations demonstrate these dysfunctions by accom-panying cognitive symptoms such as problems with memory and concentration. Modern imaging techniques show volume reduction of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex. These findings are in line with post-mortem studies of patients with depressive disorder and they point to a significant decrease of neuronal and glial cells in cortico-limbic regions which can be seen as a consequence of alterations in neuronal plasticity in this disorder. This could be triggered by an increase of free radicals which in turn eventually leads to cell death and consequently atrophy of vulnerable neuronal and glial cell population in these regions. Therefore, research on increased oxidative stress in unipolar depressive disorder, mediated by elevated concentrations of free radicals, has been undertaken. This review gives a compre-hensive overview over the current literature discussing the involvement of oxidative stress and free radicals in depression. Methods: We have carried out a medline search " oxidative stress depression " , " oxidative stress affective disorders " , " free radicals and depression " , " free radicals and affective disorders " " antidepressants oxidative stress " " antidepressants and free radicals " . We found nu-merous reports elaborating depressive disorder and oxidative stress. Most of the previous studies concentrated on investigating antioxi-dants in human blood as well as in animal models. However, few of these reports were able to show correlations of reduced oxidative stress with antidepressant treatment and clinical outcome measures. Fewer studies elaborated the concentrations of antioxidants in the human brain and some pro-oxidative enzymes in depression. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the complex role of oxida-tive stress in the aetiology of depression.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) include the statistical tests used to compare groups (treatments) often following a significant effect reported in one of many types of linear models. Due to a variety of data and statistical considerations, several dozen MCTs have been developed over the decades, with tests ranging from very similar to each other to very different from each other. Many scientific disciplines use MCTs, including {$>$}40,000 reports of their use in ecological journals in the last 60 years. Despite the ubiquity and utility of MCTs, several issues remain in terms of their correct use and reporting. In this study, we evaluated 17 different MCTs. We first reviewed the published literature for recommendations on their correct use. Second, we created a simulation that evaluated the performance of nine common MCTs. The tests examined in the simulation were those that often overlapped in usage, meaning the selection of the test based on fit to the data is not unique and that the simulations could inform the selection of one or more tests when a researcher has choices. Based on the literature review and recommendations: planned comparisons are overwhelmingly recommended over unplanned comparisons, for planned non-parametric comparisons the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U test is recommended, Scheffé’s S test is recommended for any linear combination of (unplanned) means, Tukey’s HSD and the Bonferroni or the Dunn-Sidak tests are recommended for pairwise comparisons of groups, and that many other tests exist for particular types of data.

  abstract = {The influence of genes and the environment on the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) continues to motivate neuropsychological research, with one consistent focus being the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene, given its impact on the integrity of the hippocampal memory system. Research into human navigation also considers the BDNF gene in relation to hippocampal dependent spatial processing. This speculative paper brings together trauma and spatial processing for the first time and presents exploratory research into their interactions with BDNF. We propose that quantifying the impact of BDNF on trauma and spatial processing is critical and may well explain individual differences in clinical trauma treatment outcomes and in navigation performance. Research has already shown that the BDNF gene influences PTSD severity and prevalence as well as navigation behaviour. However, more data are required to demonstrate the precise hippocampal dependent processing mechanisms behind these influences in different populations and environmental conditions. This paper provides insight from recent studies and calls for further research into the relationship between allocentric processing, trauma processing and BDNF. We argue that research into these neural mechanisms could transform PTSD clinical practice and professional support for individuals in trauma-exposing occupations such as emergency response, law enforcement and the military.},

  abstract = {Significance             Complex learning and memory are believed to require the weakening or elimination of synapses in the brain, a process mediated by adhesion molecules, which maintain synapse strength and stability. In the present study, we examine in vivo the effects of stabilization of β-catenin, an intracellular protein that is a component of the cadherin adhesion complex. We find that stabilization of β-catenin in the brain prevents normal activity-dependent downscaling of synapse strength, resulting in a striking impairment in cognitive flexibility. These results demonstrate that β-catenin plays an important role in learning and memory and that aberrant increases in synaptic adhesion can have detrimental effects on cognitive function.           ,              The cadherin/β-catenin adhesion complex is a key mediator of the bidirectional changes in synapse strength which are believed to underlie complex learning and memory. In the present study, we demonstrate that stabilization of β-catenin in the hippocampus of adult mice results in significant impairments in cognitive flexibility and spatial reversal learning, including impaired extinction during the reversal phase of the Morris water maze and deficits in a delayed nonmatch to place T-maze task. In accordance with these deficits, β-catenin stabilization was found to abolish long-term depression by stabilizing cadherin at the synaptic membrane and impairing AMPA receptor endocytosis, while leaving basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation unaffected. These results demonstrate that the β-catenin/cadherin adhesion complex plays an important role in learning and memory and that aberrant increases in synaptic adhesion can have deleterious effects on cognitive function.},

  abstract = {The widely accepted stress-diathesis hypothesis of depression postulates that genetic factors contribute to biological vulnerability. Based on this concept, the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model was developed. Most effects of UCMS can be reversed by antidepressant agents, illustrating a strong predictive validity. In rodents, UCMS also has good face validity as it can elicit depression-like symptoms. While abundant for rats, the UCMS literature on mice is relatively limited. Reports sometimes are contradictory, making it difficult to establish a clear profile of stress-induced depression-like behaviors in mice. As different groups often use different strains for their experiments, differential strain susceptibility to UCMS may provide at least a partial explanation of these discrepancies. Moreover, differences in testing methodology add another level of complexity. Very little is known about the role of genetic factors and their interactions with the environment in the development of stress-induced behavioral changes relevant to depression, though recent studies unequivocally demonstrated the effects of specific gene polymorphisms on stress-induced depressive symptoms, as well as the effects of stress on gene expression. In the present study, we investigated the effects of UCMS on a battery of different tests measuring anxiety and depression-like behaviors in three behaviorally and genetically distinct inbred strains. The goals of these experiments are to obtain a clearer behavioral profile of genetically/phenotypically distant mouse strains after UCMS treatment and to evaluate the limitations and strengths of the UCMS model in mice. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Deficits in spatial memory come with age-related cognitive decline, are marked in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with cognitive deficits in autism. In most of these disorders, a change in the brain areas engaged in the spatial reference system processing has been documented. However, the spatial memory deficits observed during physiological and pathological aging are quite different. While patients with AD and MCI have a general spatial navigation impairment in both allocentric and egocentric strategies, healthy older adults are particularly limited in the allocentric navigation, but they can still count on egocentric navigation strategy to solve spatial tasks. Therefore, specific navigational tests should be considered for differential diagnosis between healthy and pathological aging conditions. Finally, more research is still needed to better understand the spatial abilities of autistic individuals.},

  abstract = {In patients affected by Parkinson’s disease (PD), up to 50\% of them experience cognitive changes, and psychiatric disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, often precede the onset of motor symptoms and have a negative impact on their quality of life. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the presence of intracellular inclusions, called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, composed mostly of α-synuclein (α-Syn). Much of PD research has focused on the role of α-Syn aggregates in the degeneration of SNc DA neurons due to the impact of striatal DA deficits on classical motor phenotypes. However, abundant Lewy pathology is also found in other brain regions including the midbrain raphe nuclei, which may contribute to non-motor symptoms. Indeed, dysfunction of the serotonergic (5-HT) system, which regulates mood and emotional pathways, occurs during the premotor phase of PD. However, little is known about the functional consequences of α-Syn inclusions in this neuronal population other than DA neurons. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of α-Syn and its role in regulating the 5-HT function in health and disease. Understanding the relative contributions to α-Syn-linked alterations in the 5-HT system may provide a basis for identifying PD patients at risk for developing depression and could lead to a more targeted therapeutic approach.},

Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n\,=\,53) or placebo with therapy (n\,=\,51). Overall, 26.9\% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1\% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9\%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7\%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95\% confidence interval (CI)) was −23.7 (−26.94, −20.44) for MDMA-AT versus −14.8 (−18.28, −11.28) for placebo with therapy (P\,{$<$}\,0.001, d\,=\,0.7).

Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n\,=\,5 (9.4\%); placebo with therapy, n\,=\,2 (3.9\%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs.

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5\%), 328 (62.1\%) and 92 (17.4\%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected Escherichia coli to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of E. coli displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect E. coli resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3\%), 200 (51.7\%) and 89 (23.0\%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator E. coli from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8\%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; χ2 (1,N = 336) = 6.53, p = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true “One Health” approach.},

In this review, we intend to describe the anatomy of the dentate gyrus as a part of the hippocampus, which has an essential role in pattern separation. Other adjacent neural populations are further addressed, too. Models of the dentate gyrus, including neurocomputation and functional, that represent the process of separating patterns in the dentate gyrus are reviewed and analyzed. In this regard, five major models were highlighted and compared from several perspectives. While some models are based on the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus regions, others point to the mediation of cornu ammonis (CA3) as well. Models with the lowest cells for pattern separation are addressed first. Finally, inhibition is discussed in the comparison of pattern separation models.},

  abstract = {Dysfunction in corticolimbic circuits that mediate the extinction of learned fear responses is thought to underlie the perseveration of fear in stress-related psychopathologies, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Chronic stress produces dendritic hypertrophy in basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dendritic hypotrophy in medial prefrontal cortex, whereas acute stress leads to hypotrophy in both BLA and prelimbic cortex. Additionally, both chronic and acute stress impair extinction retrieval. Here, we examined the effects of a single elevated platform stress on extinction learning and dendritic morphology in infralimbic cortex, a region considered to be critical for extinction. Acute stress produced resistance to extinction, as well as dendritic retraction in infralimbic cortex. Spine density on apical and basilar terminal branches was unaffected by stress. However, animals that underwent conditioning and extinction had decreased spine density on apical terminal branches. Thus, whereas dendritic morphology in infralimbic cortex appears to be particularly sensitive to stress, changes in spines may more sensitively reflect learning. Further, in stressed rats that underwent conditioning and extinction, the level of extinction learning was correlated with spine densities, in that rats with poorer extinction retrieval had more immature spines and fewer thin spines than rats with better extinction retrieval, suggesting that stress may have impaired learning-related spine plasticity. These results may have implications for understanding the role of medial prefrontal cortex in learning deficits associated with stress-related pathologies.},

  abstract = {A recent meta-analysis of antidepressant trials is the largest conducted to date. Although it claims to prove antidepressant effectiveness beyond dispute, the main outcome is response rates, which are derived from continuous data in a process that can inflate differences between groups. The standardised mean difference of 0.3 is in line with other meta-analyses that show small differences between antidepressants and placebo that are unlikely to be clinically significant. Other factors likely to exaggerate the effects are discussed, and evidence on associations between antidepressant effects and severity and outcomes of long-term treatment is considered. Clinicians need to have open discussions with patients about the limitations of antidepressant research, the lack of evidence that antidepressants correct a chemical imbalance or other brain abnormality, and the range of adverse effects and mental and physical alterations they can produce.},

  abstract = {The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest n\,=\,1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (n\,=\,1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT1A receptor (largest n\,=\,561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest n\,=\,1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However,~effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (n\,=\,566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (n\,=\,75). Another systematic review (n\,=\,342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (n\,=\,407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (n\,=\,115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (n\,=\,43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.},

This review focuses on the effects of distinct classes of antidepressant treatments on the serotonergic and the noradrenergic systems of the hippocampus, which is one of the brain limbic areas thought to be relevant in depression: it illustrates the complexity of action of these treatments in a single brain area. First, the basic elements (receptors, second messengers, ion channels, ...) of the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems of the hippocampus are revisited and compared. Second, the extensive interactions occurring between the serotonergic and the noradrenergic systems of the brain are described. Finally, issues concerning the short- and long-term effects of antidepressant treatments on these systems are broadly discussed. Although there are some contradictions, the bulk of data suggests that antidepressant treatments work in the hippocampus by increasing and decreasing, respectively, serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. This hypothesis is discussed in the context of the purported function of the hippocampus in the formation of memory traces and emotion-related behaviors.},

  abstract = {Exposure to chronic stress can have broad effects on health ranging from increased predisposition for neuropsychiatric disorders to deregulation of immune responses. The chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol has been widely used to study the impact of stress exposure in several animal models and consists in the random, intermittent, and unpredictable exposure to a variety of stressors during several weeks. CUS has consistently been shown to induce behavioral and immunological alterations typical of the chronic stress-response. Unfortunately C57BL/6 mice, one of the most widely used mouse strains, due to the great variety of genetically modified lines, seem to be resistant to the commonly used 4-week-long CUS protocol. The definition of an alternative CUS protocol allowing the use of C57BL/6 mice in chronic stress experiments is a need. Here, we show that by extending the CUS protocol to 8 weeks is possible to induce a chronic stress-response in C57BL/6 mice, as revealed by abrogated body weight gain, increased adrenals weight, and an overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with increased levels of serum corticosterone. Moreover, we also observed stress-associated behavioral alterations, including the potentiation of anxious-like and depressive-like behaviors and a reduction of exploratory behavior, as well as subtle stress-related changes in the cell population of the thymus and of the spleen. The present protocol for C57BL/6 mice consistently triggers the spectrum of CUS-induced changes observed in rats and, thus, will be highly useful to researchers that need to use this particular mouse strain as an animal model of neuropsychiatric disorders and/or immune deregulation related to CUS.},

  abstract = {Ketamine, a non-selective inhibitor of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) channels is used in anesthetic or sub-anesthetic doses to induce analgesia, amnesia, to suppress fear, anxiety and depression. Although the ketamine's effect on memory acquisition is known, its effects on other aspects of memory are controversial. Morris water maze is a task which assesses spatial learning and memory. This study was aimed to assess the ketamine's differential effect on water maze memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were trained in water maze single training session. 24 h later a probe trial which was consisted of a single trial without platform was done. To assess the effect of ketamine on water maze memory acquisition it was administered before training; to assess its effect on memory consolidation it was administered immediately after training and to assess its effect on memory retrieval it was injected before probe trial. Ketamine both in sub-anesthetic and anesthetic doses impaired water maze memory acquisition, its anesthetic dose but not sub-anesthetic dose impaired memory consolidation and on retrieval stage, both doses deteriorated memory retrieval. It seems that NMDA receptor activity is not just necessary during water maze memory acquisition but also their post-learning reactivation is required to maintain memory consolidation and retrieval. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial coding relative to oneself has been associated with a brain network distinct from spatial coding using a cognitive map independently of the actual position. These differences were, however, revealed by a variety of tasks from both static conditions, using a series of images, and dynamic conditions, using movements through space. We aimed to clarify how these paradigms correspond to each other concerning the neural correlates of the use of egocentric and allocentric reference frames. We review here studies of allocentric and egocentric judgments used in static two- and three-dimensional tasks and compare their results with the findings from spatial navigation studies. We argue that neural correlates of allocentric coding in static conditions but using complex three-dimensional scenes and involving spatial memory of participants resemble those in spatial navigation studies, while allocentric representations in two-dimensional tasks are connected with other perceptual and attentional processes. In contrast, the brain networks associated with the egocentric reference frame in static two-dimensional and three-dimensional tasks and spatial navigation tasks are, with some limitations, more similar. Our review demonstrates the heterogeneity of experimental designs focused on spatial reference frames. At the same time, it indicates similarities in brain activation during reference frame use despite this heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Counting cells in fluorescent microscopy is a tedious, time-consuming task that researchers have to accomplish to assess the effects of different experimental conditions on biological structures of interest. Although such objects are generally easy to identify, the process of manually annotating cells is sometimes subject to fatigue errors and suffers from arbitrariness due to the operator’s interpretation of the borderline cases. We propose a Deep Learning approach that exploits a fully-convolutional network in a binary segmentation fashion to localize the objects of interest. Counts are then retrieved as the number of detected items. Specifically, we introduce a Unet-like architecture, cell ResUnet (c-ResUnet), and compare its performance against 3 similar architectures. In addition, we evaluate through ablation studies the impact of two design choices, (i) artifacts oversampling and (ii) weight maps that penalize the errors on cells boundaries increasingly with overcrowding. In summary, the c-ResUnet outperforms the competitors with respect to both detection and counting metrics (respectively, \$\$F\_1\$\$score = 0.81 and MAE = 3.09). Also, the introduction of weight maps contribute to enhance performances, especially in presence of clumping cells, artifacts and confounding biological structures. Posterior qualitative assessment by domain experts corroborates previous results, suggesting human-level performance inasmuch even erroneous predictions seem to fall within the limits of operator interpretation. Finally, we release the pre-trained model and the annotated dataset to foster research in this and related fields.},

Here, we report an increase in the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus, accompanied by γ-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor–dependent impairment of synaptic plasticity and enhancement of activity-dependent changes in excitability in anesthetized adult mice deficient for the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TNR). TNR-deficient mice showed faster reversal learning, improved working memory, and enhanced reactivity to novelty than wild-type littermates. Remarkably, in wild-type and TNR-deficient mice, faster reversal learning rates correlated at the individual animal level with ratios of parvalbumin-positive interneurons to granule cells and densities of parvalbumin-positive terminals on somata of granule cells. Our data demonstrate that modification of the extracellular matrix by ablation of TNR leads to a new structural and functional design of the dentate gyrus, with enhanced GABAergic innervation, that is, enhanced ratio of inhibitory to excitatory cells, and altered plasticity, promoting working memory and reversal learning. In wild-type mice, the enhanced ratio of inhibitory to excitatory cells in the dentate gyrus also positively correlated with reversal learning, indicating that level of inhibition regulates specific aspects of learning independent of the TNR gene.},

This process, named adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), is a striking form of neural plasticity that occurs in the brains of numerous mammalian species. Direct evidence of adult neurogenesis in humans has remained elusive, although the occurrence of this phenomenon in the human dentate gyrus has been demonstrated in seminal studies and recent research that have applied distinct approaches to birthdate newly generated neurons and to validate markers of adult-born neurons. Our data point to the persistence of AHN until the 10th decade of human life, as well as to marked impairments in this process in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, our work demonstrates that the methods used to process and analyze postmortem human brain samples can limit the detection of various markers of AHN to the point of making them undetectable. In this Dual Perspectives article, we highlight the critical methodological aspects that should be strictly controlled in human studies and the robust evidence that supports the occurrence of AHN in humans. We also put forward reasons that may account for current discrepancies on this topic. Finally, the unresolved questions and future challenges awaiting the field are highlighted.},

However, recent studies show that forgetting might be a purposeful mechanism with dedicated molecular pathways. This has opened new avenues for the study of memory processes and their manipulation. This review article focuses on the proposed molecular pathways that could underlie forgetting (postsynaptic glutamate receptors and their subunit composition, structural proteins, kinases, phosphatases, and neuromodulators), and reviews the latest contributions to this topic. The discussed molecular pathways are then related to synaptic depotentiation, which is a proposed mechanism underlying forgetting.},

  abstract = {Alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, and the glutamatergic system represents a treatment target for depression. To summarize the nature of glutamatergic alterations in patients with depression, we conducted a meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance (1H-MRS) spectroscopy studies examining levels of glutamate. We used the search terms: depress* AND (MRS OR “magnetic resonance spectroscopy”). The search was performed with MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. The inclusion criteria were 1H-MRS studies comparing levels of glutamate\,+\,glutamine (Glx), glutamate, or glutamine between patients with depression and healthy controls. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to assess group differences in the levels of glutamatergic neurometabolites. Forty-nine studies met the eligibility criteria, which included 1180 patients and 1066 healthy controls. There were significant decreases in Glx within the medial frontal cortex (SMD\,=\,−0.38; 95\% CI, −0.69 to −0.07) in patients with depression compared with controls. Subanalyses revealed that there was a significant decrease in Glx in the medial frontal cortex in medicated patients with depression (SMD\,=\,−0.50; 95\% CI, −0.80 to −0.20), but not in unmedicated patients (SMD\,=\,−0.27; 95\% CI, −0.76 to 0.21) compared with controls. Overall, decreased levels of glutamatergic metabolites in the medial frontal cortex are linked with the pathophysiology of depression. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that depression may be associated with abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission.},

  abstract = {The brain noradrenergic system is activated by acute stress. The post-synaptic effects of norepinephrine (NE), exerted at a cellular or neural circuit level, have been described as modulatory in nature, as NE facilitates responses evoked in target cells by both excitatory and inhibitory afferent input. Over the past few years, we have undertaken a series of studies to understand how these cellular modulatory effects of NE, elicited by acute stress, might translate into modulation of the behavioral-affective components of the whole-animal response to stress. Using microdialysis, we have demonstrated that acute immobilization stress activates NE release in a number of stress-related limbic forebrain target regions, such as the central and medial amygdala, lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial prefrontal cortex, and lateral septum. Using microinjections of adrenergic antagonist drugs directly into these regions, we have shown that this stress-induced release of NE facilitates a number of anxiety-like behavioral responses that are mediated in these regions, including stress-induced reduction of open-arm exploration on the elevated plus-maze, stress-induced reduction of social interaction behavior, and activation of defensive burying behavior by contact with an electrified probe. Dysregulation of the brain noradrenergic system may be a factor in determining vulnerability to stress-related pathology, or in the interaction of genetic vulnerability and environmental sensitization. Compared to outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, we have shown that the modulatory effect of NE is deficient in Wistar-Kyoto rats, which also exhibit attenuated behavioral reactivity to acute stress, as well as increased vulnerability to stress-induced gastric ulcers and exaggerated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Further, repeated exposure to mild intermittent cold stress resulted in a much greater sensitization of both the brain noradrenergic system and the HPA axis in Wistar-Kyoto rats compared to Sprague-Dawley rats. The recruitment of a robust noradrenergic facilitatory influence following repeated cold exposure in this previously deficient strain resulted in an aberrant HPA response, which may be illustrative of the kinds of neurobiological changes that may contribute to the development of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other anxiety disorders in predisposed or susceptible individuals. On the other side of the same issue, regulatory alterations in noradrenergic neurotransmission, or in the stress-modulatory functions of NE, may be important in the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressant drug treatment. We present recent preliminary results addressing the effects of chronic treatment with the selective NE reuptake inhibitor, desipramine, on acute behavioral reactivity to stress. A better understanding of the role of NE in adaptive responses to acute stress, the pathological consequences of prolonged, repeated or severe stress, and the mechanisms of action of drugs used to treat stress-related diseases, may contribute to the future development of more effective strategies for the treatment or even prevention of such disorders.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that rats can rapidly learn to locate an object that they can never see, hear, or smell provided it remains in a fixed spatial location relative to distal room cues. Four groups of rats were permitted to escape from opaque water onto a platform which was either just above or just below the water surface, and in either a fixed or varied location. Learning occurred rapidly except for the group for whom the escape platform was below the water surface and moved about from place to place. Transfer tests revealed that a spatial location search strategy was employed by the group for whom the platform was below water but in a fixed location. A second experiment investigated this learning further, revealing instantaneous transfer when the rats were required to approach the platform from a novel starting position. The data of both studies are discussed in relation to recent work on spatial memory in the rat. The concept of the “acuity” of spatial memory is introduced and the procedures used may provide a new approach to comparing spatial memory with classical and instrumental conditioning.},

Control studies confirmed that intrahippocampal infusions of anisomycin inhibited protein synthesis locally and that the spatial training protocols we used are subject to overnight protein synthesis-dependent consolidation. We then compared the impact of anisomycin in two conditions: when memory retrieval occurred in a reference memory task after performance had reached asymptote over several days; and after a comparable extent of training of a delayed matching-to-place task in which new memory encoding was required each day. Sensitivity to intrahippocampal anisomycin was observed only in the protocol involving new memory encoding at the time of retrieval.},

  abstract = {Systems consolidation has mostly been treated as a neural construct defined by the time-dependent change in memory representation from the hippocampus (HPC) to other structures, primarily the neocortex. Here, we identify and evaluate the explicit and implicit premises that underlie traditional or standard models and theories of systems consolidation based on evidence from research on humans and other animals. We use the principle that changes in neural representation over time and experience are accompanied by corresponding changes in psychological representations, and vice versa, to argue that each of the premises underlying traditional or standard models and theories of systems consolidation is found wanting. One solution is to modify or abandon the premises or theories and models. This is reflected in moderated models of systems consolidation that emphasize the early role of the HPC in training neocortical memories until they stabilize. The fault, however, may lie in the very concept of systems consolidation and its defining feature. We propose that the concept be replaced by one of memory systems reorganization, which does not carry the theoretical baggage of systems consolidation and is flexible enough to capture the dynamic nature of memory from inception to very long-term retention and retrieval at a psychological and neural level. The term “memory system reorganization” implies that memory traces are not fixed, even after they are presumably consolidated. Memories can continue to change as a result of experience and interactions among memory systems across the lifetime. As will become clear, hippocampal training of neocortical memories is only one type of such interaction, and not always the most important one, even at inception. We end by suggesting some principles of memory reorganization that can help guide research on dynamic memory processes that capture corresponding changes in memory at the psychological and neural levels.},

  abstract = {The hippocampal system is critical for storage and retrieval of declarative memories, including memories for locations and events that take place at those locations. Spatial memories place high demands on capacity. Memories must be distinct to be recalled without interference and encoding must be fast. Recent studies have indicated that hippocampal networks allow for fast storage of large quantities of uncorrelated spatial information. The aim of the this article is to review and discuss some of this work, taking as a starting point the discovery of multiple functionally specialized cell types of the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit, such as place, grid, and border cells. We will show that grid cells provide the hippocampus with a metric, as well as a putative mechanism for decorrelation of representations, that the formation of environment-specific place maps depends on mechanisms for long-term plasticity in the hippocampus, and that long-term spatiotemporal memory storage may depend on offline consolidation processes related to sharp-wave ripple activity in the hippocampus. The multitude of representations generated through interactions between a variety of functionally specialized cell types in the entorhinal–hippocampal circuit may be at the heart of the mechanism for declarative memory formation., Hippocampal networks allow for fast storage of large quantities of uncorrelated spatial information. Functionally specialized cell types (e.g., place cells and grid cells) may form the basis of this system.},

  abstract = {A theory of cognitive mapping is developed that depends only on accepted properties of hippocampal function, namely, long-term potentiation, the place cell phenomenon, and the associative or recurrent connections made among CA3 pyramidal cells. It is proposed that the distance between the firing fields of connected pairs of CA3 place cells is encoded as synaptic resistance (reciprocal synaptic strength). The encoding occurs because pairs of cells with coincident or overlapping fields will tend to fire together in time, thereby causing a decrease in synaptic resistance via long-term potentiation; in contrast, cells with widely separated fields will tend never to fire together, causing no change or perhaps (via long-term depression) an increase in synaptic resistance. A network whose connection pattern mimics that of CA3 and whose connection weights are proportional to synaptic resistance can be formally treated as a weighted, directed graph. In such a graph, a "node" is assigned to each CA3 cell and two nodes are connected by a "directed edge" if and only if the two corresponding cells are connected by a synapse. Weighted, directed graphs can be searched for an optimal path between any pair of nodes with standard algorithms. Here, we are interested in finding the path along which the sum of the synaptic resistances from one cell to another is minimal. Since each cell is a place cell, such a path also corresponds to a path in two-dimensional space. Our basic finding is that minimizing the sum of the synaptic resistances along a path in neural space yields the shortest (optimal) path in unobstructed two-dimensional space, so long as the connectivity of the network is great enough. In addition to being able to find geodesics in unobstructed space, the same network enables solutions to the "detour" and "shortcut" problems, in which it is necessary to find an optimal path around a newly introduced barrier and to take a shorter path through a hole opened up in a preexisting barrier, respectively. We argue that the ability to solve such problems qualifies the proposed hippocampal object as a cognitive map. Graph theory thus provides a sort of existence proof demonstrating that the hippocampus contains the necessary information to function as a map, in the sense postulated by others (O'Keefe, J., and L. Nadel. 1978. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK). It is also possible that the cognitive mapping functions of the hippocampus are carried out by parallel graph searching algorithms implemented as neural processes. This possibility has the great attraction that the hippocampus could then operate in much the same way to find paths in general problem space; it would only be necessary for pyramidal cells to exhibit a strong nonpositional firing correlate.},

  abstract = {In the search for new drug targets, that may help point the way to develop fast-acting treatments for mood disorders, we have explored molecular pathways regulated by ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has consistently shown antidepressant response within a few hours of administration. Using Sprague-Dawley rats we investigated the effects of ketamine on the presynaptic release machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release at 1, 2 and 4h as well as 7 days after administration of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (15mg/kg). A large reduction in the accumulation of SNARE complexes was observed in hippocampal synaptic membranes after 1, 2 and 4h of ketamine administration. In parallel, we found a selective reduction in the expression of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I and an increase in the levels of synapsin I in hippocampal synaptosomes suggesting a mechanism by which ketamine reduces SNARE complex formation, in part, by regulating the number of synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminals. Moreover, ketamine reduced Thr286-phosphorylated αCaMKII and its interaction with syntaxin 1A, which identifies CaMKII as a potential target for second messenger-mediated actions of ketamine. In addition, despite previous reports of ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK-3, we were unable to detect regulation of its activity after ketamine administration. Our findings demonstrate that ketamine rapidly induces changes in the hippocampal presynaptic machinery similar to those that are obtained only with chronic treatments with traditional antidepressants. This suggests that reduction of neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus has possible relevance for the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

  abstract = {Objectives To investigate whether the conclusion of a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis (Cipriani et al) that antidepressants are more efficacious than placebo for adult depression was supported by the evidence. Design Reanalysis of a systematic review, with meta-analyses. Data sources 522 trials (116 477 participants) as reported in the systematic review by Cipriani et al and clinical study reports for 19 of these trials. Analysis We used the Cochrane Handbook’s risk of bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to evaluate the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence, respectively. The impact of several study characteristics and publication status was estimated using pairwise subgroup meta-analyses. Results Several methodological limitations in the evidence base of antidepressants were either unrecognised or underestimated in the systematic review by Cipriani et al. The effect size for antidepressants versus placebo on investigator-rated depression symptom scales was higher in trials with a ‘placebo run-in’ study design compared with trials without a placebo run-in design (p=0.05). The effect size of antidepressants was higher in published trials compared with unpublished trials (p{$<$}0.0001). The outcome data reported by Cipriani et al differed from the clinical study reports in 12 (63\%) of 19 trials. The certainty of the evidence for the placebo-controlled comparisons should be very low according to GRADE due to a high risk of bias, indirectness of the evidence and publication bias. The mean difference between antidepressants and placebo on the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (range 0–52 points) was 1.97 points (95\% CI 1.74 to 2.21). Conclusions The evidence does not support definitive conclusions regarding the benefits of antidepressants for depression in adults. It is unclear whether antidepressants are more efficacious than placebo.},

However, it remains largely unknown how information is represented in this region. Here, we recorded neuronal activity in the DG using Ca2+ imaging in freely moving mice and analyzed this activity using machine learning. The activity patterns of populations of DG neurons enabled us to successfully decode position, speed, and motion direction in an open field, as well as current and future location in a T-maze, and each individual neuron was diversely and independently tuned to these multiple information types. Our data also showed that each type of information is unevenly distributed in groups of DG neurons, and different types of information are independently encoded in overlapping, but different, populations of neurons. In alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (αCaMKII) heterozygous knockout mice, which present deficits in spatial remote and working memory, the decoding accuracy of position in the open field and future location in the T-maze were selectively reduced. These results suggest that multiple types of information are independently distributed in DG neurons.},

Indeed, AD exhibits abnormality in cognitive behaviors and higher susceptibility to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Various factors including aging, sex difference and NPS severity, are implicated during in development of AD. In this study, we evaluated behavioral abnormalities of AD model, PDAPP transgenic mice at young age using the Morris Water Maze test, which was established to assess hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We found that female AD model mice exhibited spatial learning dysfunction and highly susceptible to NPS such as anxiety and depression, whereas spatial reference memory function was comparable in female PDAPP Tg mice to female wild type (WT) mice. Spatial learning function was comparable in male AD model mice to male WT mice. Multiple regression analysis showed that spatial learning dysfunction was associated with NPS severity such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the analysis showed that spatial reference memory function was associated with status of depression, but not anxiety. Thus, these results suggest female dominance of spatial learning dysfunction in the AD model mice accompanying increased NPS severity. The understandings of AD model may be useful for the development of therapeutic agents and methods in human AD.},

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a form of age-related dementia, and loss of cholinergic neurons is intimately associated with development of AD symptoms. We and others have reported that neural cell transplantation ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. It remains largely unclear whether neural cell transplantation ameliorates the NPS of AD. It would be interesting to determine whether NPS correlates with cognitive dysfunctions before and after neural cell transplantation in AD model mice. Based on the revalidation of our previous data from a Morris water maze test, we found that neural cell transplantation improved anxiety and depression significantly and marginally affected locomotion activity in AD mice. A correlation analysis revealed that the spatial learning function of AD mice was correlated with their NPS scores both before and after cell transplantation in a similar manner. In contrast, in the mice subjected to cell transplantation, spatial reference memory function was not correlated with NPS scores. These results suggested the neural cell transplantation in the AD model mice significantly improved NPS to the same degree as cognitive dysfunctions, possibly via distinct mechanisms, such as the cholinergic and GABAergic systems.},

  abstract = {Antidepressants in general, and fluoxetine in particular, increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in mice. Here we asked how the antidepressant fluoxetine affects behavior and AHN in a corticosterone model of depression. In three groups of adult male C57BL/6j mice we administered either vehicle (VEH), corticosterone (CORT) treatment to induce a depression-like state or corticosterone plus a standard dose of fluoxetine (CORT+FLX). Following treatment, mice performed the open field test, the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test and the splash test. Neurogenesis was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry using BrdU and neuronal maturation markers. Unexpectedly, 42\% of the CORT+FLX-treated mice exhibited severe weight loss, seizures and sudden death. As expected, the CORT treated group had altered behaviors compared to the VEH group, but the CORT+FLX mice that survived did not show any behavioral improvement compared to the CORT group. Antidepressants generally increase neurogenesis and here we also found that compared to CORT mice, CORT+FLX mice that survived had a significantly greater density of BrdU+, BrdU+DCX+ and BrdU+NeuN+ cells, suggesting increased neurogenesis. Moreover, the density of BrdU+NeuN+ cells was increased in an aberrant location, the hilus, of CORT+FLX mice, similar to previous studies describing aberrant neurogenesis following seizures. In conclusion, fluoxetine could induce considerable adverse effects in wild type mice, including seizure-like activity. Fluoxetine-induced neurogenesis increases could be related to this activity, therefore proneurogenic effects of fluoxetine and other antidepressants, especially in the absence of any behavioral therapeutic effects, should be interpreted with caution.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that housing mice with toys and running wheels increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and enhances performance on the water maze. However, the relative contribution of running versus enrichment to the neurogenic and pro-cognitive effects is not clear. Recently, it was demonstrated that enrichment devoid of running wheels does not significantly enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice. However, novel toys were not rotated into the cages, and dietary enrichment was not included, so it could be argued that the environment was not enriched enough. In addition, only females were studied, and animals were group-housed, making it impossible to record individual running behavior or to determine the time spent running versus exploring the toys. Therefore, we repeated the study in singly housed male C57BL/6J mice and enhanced enrichment by rotating novel tactile, visual, dietary, auditory, and vestibular stimuli into the cages. Mice were housed for 32days in one of four groups: running-only, enrichment-only, running plus enrichment, and standard cage. The first 10days bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to label dividing cells. The last 5days mice were tested on the water maze, and then euthanized to measure number of BrdU cells co-labeled with neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) in the dentate gyrus. Mice in the running-only group ran, on average, equivalent distances as animals in the running plus enrichment group. The combination of enrichment and running did not significantly increase hippocampal neurogenesis any more than running alone did. Animals in the running-only condition were the only group to show enhanced acquisition on water maze relative to standard cage controls. We confirm and extend the conclusion that environmental enrichment alone does not significantly increase hippocampal neurogenesis or bestow spatial learning benefits in male C57BL/6J mice, even when the modalities of enrichment are very broad.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal-neocortical interactions in memory have typically been characterized within the "standard model" of memory consolidation. In this view, memory storage initially requires hippocampal linking of dispersed neocortical storage sites, but over time this need dissipates, and the hippocampal component is rendered unnecessary. This change in function over time is held to account for the retrograde amnesia (RA) gradients often seen in patients with hippocampal damage. Recent evidence, however, calls this standard model into question, and we have recently proposed a new approach, the "multiple memory trace" (MMT) theory. In this view, hippocampal ensembles are always involved in storage and retrieval of episodic information, but semantic (gist) information can be established in neocortex, and will survive damage to the hippocampal system if enough time has elapsed. This approach accounts more readily for the very long RA gradients often observed in amnesia. We report the results of analytic and connectionist simulations that demonstrate the feasibility of MMT. We also report a neuroimaging study showing that retrieval of very remote (25-year-old) memories elicits as much activation in hippocampus as retrieval of quite recent memories. Finally, we report new data from the study of patients with temporal lobe damage, using more sensitive measures than previously the case, showing that deficits in both episodic and spatial detail can be observed even for very remote memories. Overall, these findings indicate that the standard model of memory consolidation, which views the hippocampus as having only a temporary role in memory, is wrong. Instead, the data support the view that for episodic and spatial detail the hippocampal system is always necessary.},

The standard model and multiple trace theory are spelled out, their implications are outlined, and their fit to the data from a number of approaches is evaluated. We conclude that the data from neuroimaging studies strongly support multiple trace theory, that data from neuropsychological studies favor but does not conclusively support multiple trace theory, while evidence from a new approach, the study of prospective memory, also supporting multiple trace theory, offers a promising new way to distinguish between these two theories. Work with animals is largely consistent with this conclusion. We suggest that the hippocampal and neocortical systems are critical for different forms of memory, and that the shift of memory from dependence on hippocampus to dependence on neocortex during consolidation is a reflection of the fact that memory often is transformed with time, becoming more generic in nature. Insofar as detailed episodic recollections are retained, the data show that they are dependent on the hippocampal system, much as multiple trace theory postulated.},

Much evidence indicates that this consolidation involves the synthesis of new proteins in neurons. The lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala (LBA) are believed to be a site of memory storage in fear learning. Infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin into the LBA shortly after training prevents consolidation of fear memories. Here we show that consolidated fear memories, when reactivated during retrieval, return to a labile state in which infusion of anisomycin shortly after memory reactivation produces amnesia on later tests, regardless of whether reactivation was performed 1 or 14 days after conditioning. The same treatment with anisomycin, in the absence of memory reactivation, left memory intact. Consistent with a time-limited role for protein synthesis production in consolidation, delay of the infusion until six hours after memory reactivation produced no amnesia. Our data show that consolidated fear memories, when reactivated, return to a labile state that requires de novo protein synthesis for reconsolidation. These findings are not predicted by traditional theories of memory consolidation.},

The aim of this paper is threefold: (1) to review Heinrich Klüver's behavioral studies on monkeys that led up to his temporal lobe experiments with Paul Bucy; (2) to understand why Brown and Schäfer dismissed the behavioral changes in temporal lobe monkeys they had observed fifty years prior to the studies of Klüver and Bucy; and (3) to show that Klüver's phenomenologically motivated conceptual paradigm helped to unify both neuropsychological and neuroanatomical theories regarding the visual and emotive functions of the non‐human primate temporal lobe.},

  abstract = {Our body has a remarkable ability to remember its past encounters with allergens, pathogens, wounds and irritants, and to react more quickly to the next experience. This accentuated sensitivity also helps us to cope with new threats. Despite maintaining a state of readiness and broadened resistance to subsequent pathogens, memories can also be maladaptive, leading to chronic inflammatory disorders and cancers. With the ever-increasing emergence of new pathogens, allergens and pollutants in our world, the urgency to unravel the molecular underpinnings of these phenomena has risen to new heights. Here we reflect on how the field of inflammatory memory has evolved, since 2007, when researchers realized that non-specific memory is contained in the nucleus and propagated at the epigenetic level. We review the flurry of recent discoveries revealing that memory is not just a privilege of the immune system but also extends to epithelia of the skin, lung, intestine and pancreas, and to neurons. Although still unfolding, epigenetic memories of inflammation have now been linked to possible brain disorders such as Alzheimer disease, and to an elevated risk of cancer. In this Review, we consider the consequences-good and bad-of these epigenetic memories and their implications for human health and disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner?s instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

As such, statistical approaches have traditionally focused on testing specific predictions based upon well-focused hypotheses. However, neuroscience data are often derived from repeated measurements and stimulus type presentations with a limited number of subjects, some of which may have incomplete data per subject. Here we provide an introduction to a group of diverse and powerful statistical approaches, which we term the '5 Ms', which have been successfully used in other fields of biological research facing similar constraints. Specifically, we detail how M1: meta-analysis can combine, reconcile, and analyse between- and within-study results, M2: mixed-effects modelling is beneficial through replacing statistical tests involving pseudoreplication, M3: multiple imputation may be used to account for the biases caused by missing data arising from incomplete experimental protocols, and M4: model averaging from information-theoretic approaches allows to discriminate among alternative functional hypotheses. We also provide a brief introduction to Bayesian statistics using M5: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Taken together, these approaches provide neuroscientists with a robust statistical toolbox containing elements that alleviate some of the analytical constraints generated by limited sample sizes, repeated subject use, and incomplete replicates of experimental manipulation.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Here, we provide an updated toolbox, developed as a Python package, that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), performance improvements, and active-learning-based network refinement. We provide a step-by-step procedure for using DeepLabCut that guides the user in creating a tailored, reusable analysis pipeline with a graphical processing unit (GPU) in 1–12 h (depending on frame size). Additionally, we provide Docker environments and Jupyter Notebooks that can be run on cloud resources such as Google Colaboratory.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiota is composed of a large number of microbes, usually regarded as commensal bacteria. It has become gradually clear that gastrointestinal microbiota affects gut pathophysiology and the central nervous system (CNS) function by modulating the signaling pathways of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. This bidirectional MGB axis communication primarily acts through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous systems (ANS) mechanisms. Accumulating evidence reveals that gut microbiota interacts with the host brain, and its modulation may play a critical role in the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, neuroscience research has established the significance of gut microbiota in the development of brain systems that are essential to stress-related behaviors, including depression and anxiety. Application of modulators of the MGB, such as psychobiotics (e.g., probiotics), prebiotics, and specific diets, may be a promising therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders. The present review article primarily focuses on the relevant features of the disturbances of the MGB axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and its potential mechanisms.},

DESIGN: Reanalysis of a two-arm double-blind placebo controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine patients with MDD. INTERVENTIONS: Two doses of psilocybin 25mg and daily oral placebo versus daily escitalopram and 2 doses of psilocybin 1mg, with psychological support for both groups. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS SR-16), and three other depression scales as secondary outcomes: HAMD-17, MADRS, and BDI-1A. RESULTS: Using Bayes factors and 'skeptical priors' which bias estimates towards zero, for the hypothesis that psilocybin is superior by any margin, we found indeterminate evidence for QIDS SR-16, strong evidence for BDI-1A and MADRS, and extremely strong evidence for HAMD-17. For the stronger hypothesis that psilocybin is superior by a 'clinically meaningful amount' (using literature defined values of the minimally clinically important difference), we found moderate evidence against it for QIDS SR-16, indeterminate evidence for BDI-1A and MADRS, and moderate evidence supporting it for HAMD-17. Furthermore, across the board we found extremely strong evidence for psilocybin's non-inferiority versus escitalopram. These findings were robust to prior sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This Bayesian reanalysis supports the following inferences: 1) that psilocybin did indeed outperform escitalopram in this trial, but not to an extent that was clinically meaningful--and 2) that psilocybin is almost certainly non-inferior to escitalopram. The present results provide a more precise and nuanced interpretation to previously reported results from this trial, and support the need for further research into the relative efficacy of psilocybin therapy for depression with respect to current leading treatments.

  abstract = {Clinical studies suggest the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, including ayahuasca, DMT, psilocybin, and LSD, in stress-related disorders. These substances induce cognitive, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects suggested to arise from biological changes similar to conventional antidepressants or the rapid-acting substance ketamine. The proposed route is by inducing brain neuroplasticity. This review attempts to summarize the evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity by focusing on psychedelics' cellular and molecular neuroplasticity effects after single and repeated administration. When behavioral parameters are encountered in the selected studies, the biological pathways will be linked to the behavioral effects. Additionally, knowledge gaps in the underlying biology of clinical outcomes of psychedelics are highlighted. The literature searched yielded 344 results. Title and abstract screening reduced the sample to 35; eight were included from other sources, and full-text screening resulted in the final selection of 16 preclinical and four clinical studies. Studies (n = 20) show that a single administration of a psychedelic produces rapid changes in plasticity mechanisms on a molecular, neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic level. The expression of plasticity-related genes and proteins, including Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), is changed after a single administration of psychedelics, resulting in changed neuroplasticity. The latter included more dendritic complexity, which outlasted the acute effects of the psychedelic. Repeated administration of a psychedelic directly stimulated neurogenesis and increased BDNF mRNA levels up to a month after treatment. Findings from the current review demonstrate that psychedelics induce molecular and cellular adaptations related to neuroplasticity and suggest those run parallel to the clinical effects of psychedelics, potentially underlying them. Future (pre)clinical research might focus on deciphering the specific cellular mechanism activated by different psychedelics and related to long-term clinical and biological effects to increase our understanding of the therapeutic potential of these compounds.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive bias refers to emotional influences on cognition and provides a cognitive measure of negativity- or positivity-bias through assessment of the behavioral responses to ambiguous stimuli. Thus, under negative conditions an animal is more likely to judge ambiguous stimuli as negative, and under positive conditions as positive. The transfer of past experiences to novel but similar situations is highly adaptive, as it allows the animal to anticipate on the most likely outcome of the ambiguous cues. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current state of evidence on cognitive bias in rodents under adverse and rewarding or supportive conditions. Results: In total 20 studies were identified, in which auditory, spatial, tactile, or visual tasks were used. Stressed rodents generally made fewer positive responses than their non-stressed conspecifics. Housing enrichment made rodents more positive in anticipation of ambiguous cues. Ethanol seeking rats generalized the ambiguous cues to sucrose and less to ethanol if sucrose was available. Amphetamine, fluoxetine, and ketamine shifted the bias toward positivity, while reboxetine elevated negative bias. Conclusion: The auditory tasks have been most extensively validated, followed by the tactile and spatial tasks, and finally the visual tasks. The tactile and spatial tasks use latency as readout, which is sensitive to confounding factors. It is yet uncertain whether spatial tasks measure cognitive bias. Across all tasks, with some exceptions, rodents exposed to stress show less positivity-bias when exposed to ambiguous cues, whereas rodents exposed to rewarding substances or treated with antidepressant drugs are biased toward reward. Considering the methodological heterogeneity and risk of bias, the present data should be interpreted with caution.},

Fallibilists, who point out that complete certainty cannot be achieved in empirical science, can still argue that even successions of false theories may progress toward the truth. This proposal was supported by Karl Popper with his notion of truthlikeness or verisimilitude. Popper's own technical definition failed, but the idea that scientific progress means increasing truthlikeness can be expressed by defining degrees of truthlikeness in terms of similarities between states of affairs. This paper defends the verisimilitude approach against Alexander Bird who argues that the "semantic" definition (in terms of truth or truthlikeness alone) is not sufficient to define progress, but the "epistemic" definition referring to justification and knowledge is more adequate. Here Bird ignores the crucial distinction between real progress and estimated progress, explicated by the difference between absolute (and usually unknown) degrees of truthlikeness and their evidence-relative expected values. Further, it is argued that Bird's idea of returning to the cumulative model of growth requires an implausible trick of transforming past false theories into true ones.},

Here, we investigated whether administration of ketamine, the noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors before each stress session would prevent cognitive impairments in a rat model of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent attentional set-shifting task (ASST), a measure of cognitive flexibility. Repeated restraint stress (1. h daily for 7 days) significantly and specifically impaired extra-dimensional (ED) set-shifting ability of rats. Pretreatment with ketamine (10. mg/kg, IP) completely and specifically prevented this stress-induced cognitive inflexibility. The present study demonstrates procognitive efficacy of ketamine in an animal stress model, which confirms and extends the role of the NMDA receptors in mediating stress-evoked prefrontal dysfunctions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Major depression and anxiety disorders are a social and economic burden worldwide. Serotonergic signaling has been implicated in the pathophysiology of these disorders and thus has been a crucial target for pharmacotherapy. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these disorders are still unclear. Here, we used species-optimized lentiviral vectors that were capable of efficient and specific transduction of serotonergic neurons in mice and rats for elucidation of serotonergic roles in anxiety-like behaviors and active coping behavior in both species. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that lentiviral vectors with an upstream sequence of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene efficiently transduced serotonergic neurons with a specificity of approximately 95\% in both mice and rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that these lentiviral vectors induced sufficient expression of optogenetic tools for precise control of serotonergic neurons. Using these vectors, we demonstrate that acute activation of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus increases active coping with inescapable stress in rats and mice in a time-locked manner, and that acute inhibition of these neurons increases anxiety-like behaviors specifically in rats. These findings further our understanding of the pathophysiological role of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in different species and the role of these neurons as therapeutic targets in major depression and anxiety disorders.},

Despite extensive research in this area, previous studies have failed to detect consistent evidence of cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze (MWM) task in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse. However, few studies have examined cognitive flexibility in a reversal form of the MWM task, which may illuminate subtle learning deficits.,  Methods: Adult male Fmr1 wildtype (WT) and KO mice were bred and tested in the MWM reversal paradigm. The testing paradigm consisted of two blocks per day, with 4 trials per block to locate a hidden platform. After the last trials on the fourth day of testing, the animals were given a probe trial with the platform removed. The following week, the location of the platform was switched to the opposite quadrant and the animals received 2 more days of testing, with 4 blocks in total.,  Results: As expected, Fmr1 KO mice did not display a learning deficit during the acquisition phase, F genotype (1, 24) = 0.034, p = 0.854, and performed similarly on the probe trial, F genotype (1, 23) = 0.024, p = 0.877. However, during the reversal phase of learning, Fmr1 KO mice showed deficits in their ability to learn the new location of the platform, F genotype (1, 23) = 3.93, p = 0.059. Further independent samples t-testing revealed that KO animals displayed significantly higher latency to reach the hidden platform during the third trial, t(23) = -2.96, p {$<$} 0.01.,  Conclusions: While previous studies have not demonstrated deficits in spatial memory in the Fmr1 KO model, it is possible that the acquisition phase of the task is less sensitive to deficits in learning. Future studies using this model to evaluate therapeutic interventions should consider utilizing the MWM reversal paradigm.},

  abstract = {The response styles theory (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991) was proposed to explain the insidious relationship between rumination and depression. We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by affective, cognitive, and physiological impairments that lead to maladaptive behavior. The high lifetime prevalence of this disabling condition, coupled with limitations of existing medications, make necessary the development of improved therapeutics. This requires animal models that allow investigation of key biological correlates of the disorder. Described in this article is the unpredictable chronic mild stress mouse model that can be used to screen for antidepressant drug candidates. Originally designed for rats, this model has been adapted for mice to capitalize on the advantages of this species as an experimental model, including inter-strain variability, which permits an exploration of the contribution of genetic background; the ability to create transgenic animals; and lower cost. Thus, because it combines genetic features and socio-environmental chronic stressful events, the unpredictable chronic mild stress model in mice is a relevant and valuable paradigm to gain insight into the etiological and developmental components of major depression, as well as to identify novel treatments for this condition. © 2021 The Authors.

  abstract = {Recently, evidence for endemically low statistical power has cast neuroscience findings into doubt. If low statistical power plagues neuroscience, then this reduces confidence in the reported effects. However, if statistical power is not uniformly low, then such blanket mistrust might not be warranted. Here, we provide a different perspective on this issue, analyzing data from an influential study reporting a median power of 21\% across 49 meta-analyses (Button et al., 2013). We demonstrate, using Gaussian mixture modeling, that the sample of 730 studies included in that analysis comprises several subcomponents so the use of a single summary statistic is insufficient to characterize the nature of the distribution. We find that statistical power is extremely low for studies included in meta-analyses that reported a null result and that it varies substantially across subfields of neuroscience, with particularly low power in candidate gene association studies. Therefore, whereas power in neuroscience remains a critical issue, the notion that studies are systematically underpowered is not the full story: low power is far from a universal problem. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, researchers across the biomedical and psychological sciences have become concerned with the reliability of results. One marker for reliability is statistical power: the probability of finding a statistically significant result given that the effect exists. Previous evidence suggests that statistical power is low across the field of neuroscience. Our results present a more comprehensive picture of statistical power in neuroscience: on average, studies are indeed underpowered—some very seriously so—but many studies show acceptable or even exemplary statistical power. We show that this heterogeneity in statistical power is common across most subfields in neuroscience. This new, more nuanced picture of statistical power in neuroscience could affect not only scientific understanding, but potentially policy and funding decisions for neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {Behavioural tests to assess affective states are widely used in human research and have recently been extended to animals. These tests assume that affective state influences cognitive processing, and that animals in a negative affective state interpret ambiguous information as expecting a negative outcome (displaying a negative cognitive bias). Most of these tests however, require long discrimination training. The aim of the study was to validate an exploration based cognitive bias test, using two different handling methods, as previous studies have shown that standard tail handling of mice increases physiological and behavioural measures of anxiety compared to cupped handling. Therefore, we hypothesised that tail handled mice would display a negative cognitive bias. We handled 28 female CD-1 mice for 16 weeks using either tail handling or cupped handling. The mice were then trained in an eight arm radial maze, where two adjacent arms predicted a positive outcome (darkness and food), while the two opposite arms predicted a negative outcome (no food, white noise and light). After six days of training, the mice were also given access to the four previously unavailable intermediate ambiguous arms of the radial maze and tested for cognitive bias. We were unable to validate this test, as mice from both handling groups displayed a similar pattern of exploration. Furthermore, we examined whether maze exploration is affected by the expression of stereotypic behaviour in the home cage. Mice with higher levels of stereotypic behaviour spent more time in positive arms and avoided ambiguous arms, displaying a negative cognitive bias. While this test needs further validation, our results indicate that it may allow the assessment of affective state in mice with minimal training - a major confound in current cognitive bias paradigms.

  abstract = {Abstract             Studies in mice have shown that less aversive handling methods (e.g. tunnel or cup handling) can reduce behavioural measures of anxiety in comparison to picking mice up by their tail. Despite such evidence, tail handling continues to be used routinely. Besides resistance to change accustomed procedures, this may also be due to the fact that current evidence in support of less aversive handling is mostly restricted to effects of extensive daily handling, which may not apply to routine husbandry practices. The aim of our study was to assess whether, and to what extent, different handling methods during routine husbandry induce differences in behavioural and physiological measures of stress in laboratory mice. To put the effects of handling method in perspective with chronic stress, we compared handling methods to a validated paradigm of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). We housed mice of two strains (Balb/c and C57BL/6) and both sexes either under standard laboratory conditions (CTRL) or under UCMS. Half of the animals from each housing condition were tail handled and half were tunnel handled twice per week, once during a cage change and once for a routine health check. We found strain dependent effects of handling method on behavioural measures of anxiety: tunnel handled Balb/c mice interacted with the handler more than tail handled conspecifics, and tunnel handled CTRL mice showed increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze. Mice undergoing UCMS showed increased plasma corticosterone levels and reduced sucrose preference. However, we found no effect of handling method on these stress-associated measures. Our results therefore indicate that routine tail handling can affect behavioural measures of anxiety, but may not be a significant source of chronic husbandry stress. Our results also highlight strain dependent responses to handling methods.},

  abstract = {Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neurogenesis occurs throughout adulthood within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and can be altered by psychoactive medications; however, the impact of methylphenidate on neurogenesis is not fully understood. We investigated the effects of chronic low (1~mg/kg) and high (10~mg/kg) intraperitoneal doses of methylphenidate on neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus following 28 days and 56 days of treatment. Interestingly, methylphenidate, at both doses, increased neurogenesis. However, if methylphenidate treatment was not continued, the newly generated cells did not survive after 28 days. If treatment was continued, the newly generated neurons survived only in the mice receiving low-dose methylphenidate. To investigate the mechanism for this effect, we examined levels of proteins linked to cell proliferation in the hippocampus, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and beta-catenin. BDNF or GDNF levels were not significantly different between groups. However, hippocampal VEGF, TrkB, and beta-catenin were significantly increased in mice receiving low-dose methylphenidate for 28 days compared to controls. Interestingly, high-dose methylphenidate significantly decreased beta-catenin after 28 days and decreased VEGF, beta-catenin, and TrkB after 56 days compared to controls. Thus, low-dose methylphenidate appears to increase cell proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampus, and these effects may be mediated by increase in VEGF, TrkB, and beta-catenin. While high dose methylphenidate may initially increase neuronal proliferation, newly generated neurons are unable to survive long-term, possibly due to decrease in VEGF, TrkB and beta-catenin.},

One possibility is that large hippocampal lesions indirectly disrupt (by retrograde degeneration) the function of areas that project to the hippocampus that are important for task performance or thought to be important for storing consolidated memories. We developed a discrete lesion targeting area CA1, the sole output of the hippocampus to neocortex, and tested the effects of this lesion on recent and remote memory in the watermaze task, in context fear conditioning, and in trace fear conditioning. In all three tasks, recent and remote memory were similarly impaired after CA1 lesions.

  abstract = {Depression, anxiety, and conduct disorders are common in children and adolescents, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat these conditions. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is the first approved SSRI for the treatment of depression in this population. Although it is believed that overall, fluoxetine is effective in child and adolescent psychiatry, there have been reports of specific adverse drug effects, most prominently, suicidality and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, worsening of depression, and anxiety. Chronic fluoxetine substantially increases brain extracellular 5-HT concentrations, and the juvenile developing brain may respond to supraphysiological 5-HT levels with specific adverse effects not seen or less prominent in adult brain. Using novelty-induced hypophagia, as well as open-field and elevated plus maze tests, we show that both Swiss Webster and C57Bl/6 mice, receiving fluoxetine in a clinically relevant dose and during their juvenile age corresponding to child–adolescent periods in humans, exhibit a paradoxical anxiogenic response. The adverse effects of juvenile fluoxetine disappeared upon drug discontinuation and no long-term behavioral consequences were apparent. No adverse effect to chronic fluoxetine was seen in adult mice and a dose-dependent anxiolytic effect developed. These data show that the age of the mice, independently of the strains and tests used in this study, is the determining factor of whether the response to chronic fluoxetine is anxiolytic or anxiogenic. Taken together, the response of the juvenile and adult brain to fluoxetine could be fundamentally different and the juvenile fluoxetine administration mouse model described here may help to identify the mechanism underlying this difference.},

  abstract = {The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is widely used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Chronic FLX treatment reportedly induces cellular responses in the brain, including increased adult hippocampal and cortical neurogenesis and reversal of neuron maturation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. However, because most previous studies have used rodent models, it remains unclear whether these FLX-induced changes occur in the primate brain. To evaluate the effects of FLX in the primate brain, we used immunohistological methods to assess neurogenesis and the expression of neuronal maturity markers following chronic FLX treatment (3\,mg/kg/day for 4\,weeks) in adult marmosets (n~=\,3 per group). We found increased expression of doublecortin and calretinin, markers of immature neurons, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of FLX-treated marmosets. Further, FLX treatment reduced parvalbumin expression and the number of neurons with perineuronal nets, which indicate mature fast-spiking interneurons, in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or cerebral cortex. We also found that FLX treatment increased the generation of cortical interneurons; however, significant up-regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not observed in FLX-treated marmosets. These results suggest that dematuration of hippocampal neurons and increased cortical neurogenesis may play roles in FLX-induced effects and/or side effects. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies showing hippocampal dematuration and increased cortical neurogenesis in FLX-treated rodents. In contrast, FLX did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis or dematuration of interneurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {One of the conundrums in today's stress research is why some individuals flourish and others perish under similar stressful conditions. It is recognized that this individual variability in adaptation to stress depends on the outcome of the interaction of genetic and cognitive/emotional inputs in which glucocorticoid hormones and receptors play a crucial role. Hence one approach towards understanding individual variation in stress coping is how glucocorticoid actions can change from protective to harmful. To address this question we focus on four hypotheses that are connected and not mutual exclusive. First, the classical Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis, in which the inability to cope with chronic stress causes a vicious cycle of excess glucocorticoid and downregulation of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the hippocampus triggering a feed-forward cascade of degeneration and disease. Second, the Balance Hypothesis, which takes also the limbic mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) into account and proposes that an integral limbic MR:GR imbalance is causal to altered processing of information in circuits underlying fear, reward, social behaviour and resilience, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairment of behavioural adaptation. The MR:GR balance is altered by gene variants of these receptor complexes and experience-related factors, which can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the expression of these receptors. A particular potent epigenetic stimulus is the maternal environment which is fundamental for the Maternal Mediation Hypothesis. The outcome of perinatal gene × environment interaction, and thus of MR:GR-mediated functions depends however, on the degree of 'matching' with environmental demands in later life. The Predictive Adaptation Hypothesis therefore presents a conceptual framework to examine the role of glucocorticoids in understanding individual phenotypic differences in stress-related behaviours over the lifespan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In a discussion of their book (1978), the authors argue that the brain must come equipped to impose a 3-dimensional Euclidean framework on experience—analysis suggests that object reidentification may require such a framework. This absolute, nonegocentric, spatial framework with a specific neural system centered in the hippocampus is identified. The kinds of behaviors in which such a spatial mapping system would be important are discussed, followed by an analysis of the anatomy and physiology of this system, with emphasis on the place-coded neurons recorded in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. A tentative physiological model for the hippocampal cognitive map is proposed. A review of lesion studies shows that the cognitive map notion can explain much of the data. The model is extended to humans by the assumption that spatial maps are built in one hemisphere, semantic maps in the other. The latter provide a semantic structure within which discourse can be achieved. Evidence from the study of amnesic patients is consistent with this extension. 30 peer commentaries on these arguments are included, along with a rebuttal by the authors.

In this chapter, I summarise some of the unit recording data and then outline the most recent computational version of the cognitive map theory. The novel aspects of the present version of the theory are that it identifies two allocentric parameters, the centroid and the eccentricity, which can be calculated from the array of cues in an environment and which can serve as the bases for an allocentric polar co-ordinate system. Computations within this framework enable the animal to identify its location within an environment, to predict the location which will be reached as a result of any specific movement from that location, and conversely, to calculate the spatial transformation necessary to go from the current location to a desired location. Aspects of the model are identified with the information provided by cells in the hippocampus and dorsal presubiculum. The hippocampal place cells are involved in the calculation of the centroid and the presubicular direction cells in the calculation of the eccentricity.},

Here, we investigated if female BALB/c mice derived from in-house breeding and BALB/c mice from a vendor which were shipped during their juvenile life differ in their HPA axis activity and stress responsiveness in adulthood. Results We show that already transferring the home cage to another room is a stressful event which causes an increased HPA axis activation for at least 24 hours as well as a loss of circulating lymphocytes which normalizes during a few days after transportation. However and important for the interpretation of experimental data, commercially available strain-, age- and gender-matched animals that were shipped over-night showed elevated glucocorticoid levels for up to three weeks after shipment, indicating a heightened HPA axis activation and they gained less body weight during adolescence. Four weeks after shipment, these vendor-derived mice showed increased corticosterone levels at 45-min after intraperitoneal ACTH challenge but, unexpectedly, no acute stress-induced glucocorticoid release. Surprisingly, activation of monoaminergic pathways were identified to inhibit the central nervous HPA axis activation in the vendor-derived, shipped animals since depletion of monoamines by reserpine treatment could restore the stress-induced HPA axis response during acute stress. Conclusions In-house bred and vendor-derived BALB/c mice show a different stress-induced HPA axis response in adulthood which seems to be associated with different central monoaminergic pathway activity. The stress of shipment itself and/or differences in raising conditions, therefore, can cause the development of different stress response phenotypes which needs to be taken into account when interpreting experimental data.},

The distinct developmental steps in the course of adult neurogenesis, including NSC activation, expansion, and neuronal integration, are increasingly well characterized down to the molecular level.

First, we discuss potency and identity of NSCs and the quest for a unifying model of short- and long-term self-renewal dynamics. Next, we examine cell death, specifically focusing on the early demise of newborn cells. Then, we outline the current knowledge on cell integration dynamics, discussing which (if any) neurons are replaced by newly added neurons in the hippocampal circuits. For each of these unknowns, we summarize the trajectory of studies leading to the current state of knowledge. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to fill the remaining gaps by taking advantage of novel technology to reveal currently hidden secrets in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {Neural plasticity—the ability to change and adapt in response to stimuli—is an essential aspect of healthy brain function and, in principle, can be harnessed to promote recovery from a wide variety of brain disorders. Many neuropsychiatric diseases including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders arise from an inability to weaken and/or strengthen pathologic and beneficial circuits, respectively, ultimately leading to maladaptive behavioral responses. Thus, compounds capable of facilitating the structural and functional reorganization of neural circuits to produce positive behavioral effects have broad therapeutic potential. Several known drugs and experimental therapeutics have been shown to promote plasticity, but most rely on indirect mechanisms and are slow-acting. Here, I describe psychoplastogens—a relatively new class of fast-acting therapeutics, capable of rapidly promoting structural and functional neural plasticity. Psychoplastogenic compounds include psychedelics, ketamine, and several other recently discovered fast-acting antidepressants. Their use in psychiatry represents a paradigm shift in our approach to treating brain disorders as we focus less on rectifying “chemical imbalances” and place more emphasis on achieving selective modulation of neural circuits.},

  abstract = {Reduced hippocampal volumes are probably the most frequently reported structural neuroimaging finding associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, it remains unclear whether altered hippocampal structure represents a risk factor for or a consequence of MDD. Reduced hippocampal volumes were consistently reported in subjects affected by childhood maltreatment. As the prevalence of childhood maltreatment is highly elevated in MDD populations, previous morphometric findings regarding hippocampal atrophy in MDD therefore might have been confounded by maltreatment experiences. The aim of this study was to differentiate the impact of childhood maltreatment from the influence of MDD diagnosis on hippocampal morphometry. Depressed patients (85) as well as 85 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent structural MRI. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was administered to estimate experiences of childhood maltreatment. Hippocampal volume and surface structure was examined by the use of two independent methods, automated segmentation (FSL-FIRST) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM8). In line with existing studies, MDD patients showed reduced hippocampal volumes, and childhood maltreatment was consistently associated with hippocampal volume loss in both, patients and healthy controls. However, no analysis revealed significant morphological differences between patients and controls if maltreatment experience was regressed out. Our results suggest that hippocampal alterations in MDD patients may at least partly be traced back to higher occurrence of early-life adverse experiences. Regarding the strong morphometric impact of childhood maltreatment and its distinctly elevated prevalence in MDD populations, this study provides an alternative explanation for frequently observed limbic structural abnormalities in depressed patients.},

Although much is known about how the hippocampus encodes location in world-centred coordinates, how it supports flexible navigation is less well understood. We recorded CA1 place cells while rats navigated to a goal on the honeycomb maze2. The maze tests navigation via direct and indirect paths to the goal and allows the directionality of place cells to be assessed at each choice point. Place fields showed strong directional polarization characterized by vector fields that converged to sinks distributed throughout the environment. The distribution of these ‘convergence sinks’ (ConSinks) was centred near the goal location and the population vector field converged on the goal, providing a strong navigational signal. Changing the goal location led to movement of ConSinks and vector fields towards the new goal. The honeycomb maze allows independent assessment of spatial representation and spatial action in place cell activity and shows how the latter relates to the former. The results suggest that the hippocampus creates a vector-based model to support flexible navigation, allowing animals to select optimal paths to destinations from any location in the environment.},

Decades of research have provided insights into the mechanisms by which chronic stress impairs hippocampal-mediated cognition and the corresponding reduction of hippocampal CA3 apical dendritic complexity. Yet, when chronic stress ends and time passes, which we refer to as a “post-stress rest period,” hippocampal-mediated spatial memory deficits begin to improve and CA3 apical dendritic arbors increase in complexity. The processes by which the hippocampus improves from a chronically stressed state are not simply the reversal of the mechanisms that produced spatial memory deficits and CA3 apical dendritic retraction. This review will discuss our current understanding of how a chronically stressed hippocampus improves after a post-stress rest period. Untangling the mechanisms that allow for this post-stress plasticity is a critical next step in understanding how to promote resilience in the face of stressors.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is one of the most well studied structures in the human brain. While age-related decline in hippocampal volume is well documented, most of our knowledge about hippocampal structure-function relationships was discovered in the context of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. The relationship between cognitive aging and hippocampal structure in the absence of disease remains relatively understudied. Furthermore, the few studies that have investigated the role of the hippocampus in cognitive aging have produced contradictory results. To address these issues, we assessed 93 older adults from the general community (mean age = 71.9 ± 9.3 years) on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief cognitive screening measure for dementia, and the NIH Toolbox-Cognitive Battery (NIHTB-CB), a computerized neurocognitive battery. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to estimate hippocampal volume. Lower MoCA Total (p = 0.01) and NIHTB-CB Fluid Cognition (p {$<$} 0.001) scores were associated with decreased hippocampal volume, even while controlling for sex and years of education. Decreased hippocampal volume was significantly associated with decline in multiple NIHTB-CB subdomains, including episodic memory, working memory, processing speed and executive function. This study provides important insight into the multifaceted role of the hippocampus in cognitive aging.},

In order to understand the possible role of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) neurotransmission in the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine, different groups of mice (n=10) were administered with acute ketamine (3mg/kg, i.p.), acute NMDA (75mg/kg and 150mg/kg, i.p.) and a 21-day chronic ketamine (15mg/kg, i.p./day) were administered prior to the administration of fluoxetine (20mg/kg, i.p.) in the mice. Antidepressant related behavior (immobility score) was measured using the forced swimming test. The results showed that the acute ketamine and fluoxetine alone treatments elicited a significant (p{$<$}0.05) reduction in immobility score compared with saline control. Furthermore, pre-treatment with acute ketamine significantly enhanced by the fluoxetine-induced decrease in immobility score. In contrast, pre-treatment with NMDA (150mg/kg) significantly (p{$<$}0.05) reversed fluoxetine-induced decrease in immobility score. On the other hand, chronic administration of ketamine significantly elicited an increase in immobility score as well as reversed the reduction induced by fluoxetine. Similarly, NMDA administration at both 75mg/kg and 150mg/kg increased immobility score in chronically administered ketamine groups. Furthermore, chronic administration of ketamine, followed by NMDA (75mg/kg) and fluoxetine significantly elevated the immobility score when compared with the group that received NMDA and fluoxetine but not chronically treated with ketamine. It can be suggested) that facilitation of NMDA transmission blocked fluoxetine-induced reduction in immobility score, while down-regulation of NMDA transmission is associated with increase in fluoxetine-induced antidepressant-related behavior in mice. Down-regulation of the NMDA transmission is proposed as an essential component of mechanism of suppression of depression related behaviors by fluoxetine. Modulation of NMDA transmission is suggested to be relevant in the mechanism of action of fluoxetine.},

  abstract = {Since they emerged \textasciitilde 125 million years ago, flowering plants have evolved to dominate the terrestrial landscape and survive in the most inhospitable environments on earth. At their core, these adaptations have been shaped by changes in numerous, interconnected pathways and genes that collectively give rise to emergent biological phenomena. Linking gene expression to morphological outcomes remains a grand challenge in biology, and new approaches are needed to begin to address this gap. Here, we implemented topological data analysis (TDA) to summarize the high dimensionality and noisiness of gene expression data using lens functions that delineate plant tissue and stress responses. Using this framework, we created a topological representation of the shape of gene expression across plant evolution, development, and environment for the phylogenetically diverse flowering plants. The TDA-based Mapper graphs form a well-defined gradient of tissues from leaves to seeds, or from healthy to stressed samples, depending on the lens function. This suggests there are distinct and conserved expression patterns across angiosperms that delineate different tissue types or responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Genes that correlate with the tissue lens function are enriched in central processes such as photosynthetic, growth and development, housekeeping, or stress responses. Together, our results highlight the power of TDA for analyzing complex biological data and reveal a core expression backbone that defines plant form and function. Significance statement A grand challenge in biology is to link gene expression to phenotypes across evolution, development, and the environment, but efforts have been hindered by biological complexity and dataset heterogeneity. Here, we implemented topological data analysis across thousands of gene expression datasets in phylogenetically diverse flowering plants. We created a topological representation of gene expression across plants and observed well-defined gradients of tissues from leaves to seeds, or from healthy to environmentally stressed. Using this framework, we identified a core and deeply conserved expression backbone that defines plant form and function, with key patterns that delineate plant tissues, abiotic, and biotic stresses. Our results highlight the power of topological approaches for analyzing complex biological datasets.},

However, most translational neuroscience research related to animal models of neurobehavioral disorders are carried out in male animals only. Based on published data from our laboratory on the House mouse, we discuss the following issues: (1) sex differences in social behavior of wild-derived mice; (2) artificial selection of laboratory strains and its consequences on social and reproductive competition; (3) sex-dependent effects of common experimental procedures; (4) differential effects of developmental events: the case of endocrine disruption; (5) implications for female models of stress and neurobehavioral disorders. Altogether, this review of data outline the marked differences of male and female responses to different social challenges and evinces the current lack of a relevant female mouse model of social stress. Whilst animal modelling is an important approach towards understanding mechanisms of neurobehavioral disorders, it is evident that data obtained in males may be irrelevant for inferring psychopathology and efficacy of pharmacological treatments for females.},

  abstract = {The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in mice is a model commonly used to investigate stress-induced depressive-like behaviours. The duration of the stress-inducing procedure is variable, thus making it difficult to compare results and draw general conclusions from different protocols. Here, we decided to investigate how the duration of the CUMS procedure affects behavioural changes, body weight as well as the level of plasma corticosterone in stressed and nonstressed C57BL/6J mice subjected to CUMS for 18 or 36 days. We found that 18 days of CUMS induced a robust decrease in grooming time in the splash test and a significant increase in the immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST). All of these stress-induced depression-related behavioural effects diminished or even disappeared after 36 days of CUMS. Plasma corticosterone levels were increased in the CUMS mice compared to those in the nonstressed mice. However, this effect was more pronounced in mice stressed for 18 days. On the other hand, a gradual decline in weight loss in the stressed animals was observed as the duration of the CUMS procedure increased. Altogether, the results indicate that 18 days of CUMS did not affect body weight but caused significant behavioural effects as well as a robust increase in corticosterone levels, while 36 days of CUMS induced significant reduction in weight gain but only slight or even non-significant behavioural effects. These results may indicate the presence of adaptive changes to the long-term CUMS procedure in C57BL/6J mice.},

Some authors have posited that combined psychological treatment facilitates adherence to pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between adherence to use of and efficacy of antidepressant drugs plus psychological treatment vs drug treatment alone in depressive disorders. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Current Contents, PsychInfo, Cochrane Library, and reference lists were searched, from January 1980 to November 2002. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials comparing antidepressant treatment alone with antidepressant treatment in combination with a psychological intervention in depressive disorders were considered. The decision to include studies in the meta-analysis was performed by 2 reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Three independent reviewers extracted the data, using a precoded form. Methodological quality of the studies was evaluated in terms of allocation concealment and independence of evaluators. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria, with 932 patients randomized to pharmacotherapy alone and 910 to combined treatment. Overall, patients receiving combined treatment improved significantly compared with those receiving drug treatment alone (odds ratio [OR], 1.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.52), but dropouts and nonresponders did not differ in distribution between the 2 treatment modalities (OR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.24). Studies longer than 12 weeks showed a significant advantage of combined treatment over drug treatment alone (OR, 2.21; 95\% CI, 1.22-4.03), with a significant reduction in dropouts compared with nonresponders (OR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.88). These estimates were not affected by study quality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatment combined with antidepressant therapy is associated with a higher improvement rate than drug treatment alone. In longer therapies, the addition of psychotherapy helps to keep patients in treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the improvement in response attributable to the combination of drug treatment and psychotherapy can be achieved by a combination of pharmacotherapy and a compliance-enhancing intervention.},

General human error research has shown that when humans do simple but nontrivial cognitive tasks, they inevitably have comparable error rates. The problem is that human cognitive mechanisms have evolved to "gamble" in a way that will be correct nearly all of the time but that will fail a few percent of the time. Furthermore, our brain hides its inaccuracy from us, leaving us to believe strongly in the correctness of our work despite the presence of errors. This paper looks at cognitive science aspects of spreadsheet error commission. A subsequent paper will look at spreadsheet error detection.},

  abstract = {The collective activity of a population of neurons, beyond the properties of individual cells, is crucial for many brain functions. A fundamental question is how activity correlations between neurons affect how neural populations process information. Over the past 30 years, major progress has been made on how the levels and structures of correlations shape the encoding of information in population codes. Correlations influence population coding through the organization of pairwise-activity correlations with respect to the similarity of tuning of individual neurons, by their stimulus modulation and by the presence of higher-order correlations. Recent work has shown that correlations also profoundly shape other important functions performed by neural populations, including generating codes across multiple timescales and facilitating information transmission to, and readout by, downstream brain areas to guide behaviour. Here, we review this recent work and discuss how the structures of correlations can have opposite effects on the different functions of neural populations, thus creating trade-offs and constraints for the structure–function relationships of population codes. Further, we present ideas on how to combine large-scale simultaneous recordings of neural populations, computational models, analyses of behaviour, optogenetics and anatomy to unravel how the structures of correlations might be optimized to serve multiple functions.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and devastating lung disorder of unknown origin, with very poor prognosis and no effective treatment. The disease is characterized by abnormal activation of alveolar epithelial cells, which secrete numerous mediators involved in the expansion of the fibroblast population, its differentiation to myofibroblasts, and in the exaggerated accumulation of extracellular matrix provoking the loss of lung architecture. Among the excessively produced mediators are several matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which may contribute to modify the lung microenvironment by various mechanisms. Thus, these enzymes can not only degrade all the components of the extracellular matrix, but they are also able to release, cleave and activate a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors affecting numerous cell functions including adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, recruiting and transmigration, and apoptosis. Therefore, dysregulated expression of MMPs may have profound impact on the biopathological mechanisms implicated in the development of IPF. This review focuses on the current and emerging evidence regarding the role of MMPs on the fibrotic processes in IPF as well as in mouse models of lung fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Behavioral studies have established a role for adult-born dentate granule cells in discriminating between similar memories. However, it is unclear how these cells mediate memory discrimination. Excitability is enhanced in maturing adult-born neurons, spurring the hypothesis that the activity of these cells "directly" encodes and stores memories. An alternative hypothesis posits that maturing neurons "indirectly" contribute to memory encoding by regulating excitation-inhibition balance. We evaluated these alternatives by using dentate-sensitive active place avoidance tasks to assess experience-dependent changes in dentate field potentials in the presence and absence of neurogenesis. Before training, X-ray ablation of adult neurogenesis-reduced dentate responses to perforant-path stimulation and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward. These differences were unchanged after place avoidance training with the shock zone in the initial location, which both groups learned to avoid equally well. In contrast, sham-treated mice decreased dentate responses and shifted EPSP-spike coupling leftward after the shock zone was relocated, whereas X-irradiated mice failed to show these changes in dentate function and were impaired on this test of memory discrimination. During place avoidance, excitation-inhibition coupled neural synchrony in dentate local field potentials was reduced in X-irradiated mice, especially in the θ band. The difference was most prominent during conflict learning, which is impaired in the X-irradiated mice. These findings indicate that maturing adult-born neurons regulate both functional network plasticity in response to memory discrimination and dentate excitation-inhibition coordination. The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that adult neurogenesis indirectly regulates hippocampal information processing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adult-born neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are important for flexibly using memories, but the mechanism is controversial. Using tests of hippocampus-dependent place avoidance learning and dentate electrophysiology in mice with normal or ablated neurogenesis, we find that maturing adult-born neurons are crucial only when memory must be used flexibly, and that these neurons regulate dentate gyrus synaptic and spiking responses to neocortical input rather than directly storing information, as has been proposed. A day after learning to avoid the initial or changed locations of shock, the dentate synaptic responses are enhanced or suppressed, respectively, unlike mice lacking adult neurogenesis, which did not change. The contribution of adult neurogenesis to memory is indirect, by regulating dentate excitation-inhibition coupling.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is essential for the formation and retrieval of memories and is a crucial neural structure sub-serving complex cognition. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, the~birth, migration and integration of new neurons, is thought to contribute to hippocampal circuit plasticity to augment function. We evaluated hippocampal volume in relation to brain volume in 375 mammal species and examined 71 mammal species for the presence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis using immunohistochemistry for doublecortin, an endogenous marker of immature neurons that can be used as a proxy marker for the presence of adult neurogenesis. We identified that the hippocampus in cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) is both absolutely and relatively small for their overall brain size, and found that the mammalian hippocampus scaled as an exponential function in relation to brain volume. In contrast, the amygdala was found to scale as a linear function of brain volume, but again, the relative size of the amygdala in cetaceans was small. The cetacean hippocampus lacks staining for doublecortin in the dentate gyrus and thus shows no clear signs of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This lack of evidence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, along with the small hippocampus, questions current assumptions regarding cognitive abilities associated with hippocampal function in the cetaceans. These anatomical features of the cetacean hippocampus may be related to the lack of postnatal sleep, causing a postnatal cessation of hippocampal neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications are one of the most common treatments for mood disorders. In humans, these medications are taken orally, usually once per day. Unfortunately, administration of antidepressant medications in rodent models is often through injection, oral gavage, or minipump implant, all relatively stressful procedures. The aim of the present study was to investigate how administration of the commonly used SSRI, fluoxetine, via a wafer cookie, compares to fluoxetine administration using an osmotic minipump, with regards to serum drug levels and hippocampal plasticity. For this experiment, adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided over the two administration methods: (1) cookie and (2) osmotic minipump and three fluoxetine treatment doses: 0, 5, or 10\,mg/kg/day. Results show that a fluoxetine dose of 5\,mg/kg/day, but not 10\,mg/kg/day, results in comparable serum levels of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine between the two administration methods. Furthermore, minipump administration of fluoxetine resulted in higher levels of cell proliferation in the granule cell layer (GCL) at a 5\,mg dose compared to a 10\,mg dose. Synaptophysin expression in the GCL, but not CA3, was significantly lower after fluoxetine treatment, regardless of administration method. These data suggest that the administration method and dose of fluoxetine can differentially affect hippocampal plasticity in the adult female rat.},

  abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line pharmacological treatment for a variety of anxiety-, trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Although they are efficacious, therapeutic improvements require several weeks of treatment and are often associated with an initial exacerbation of symptoms. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) has been proposed as an important target for the modulation of emotional responses and the therapeutic effects of SSRIs. Using a fear-conditioning paradigm we aimed to understand how SSRIs affect emotional learning and memory, and their effects on serotonergic circuitry. Adult male BALB/c mice were treated with vehicle (n~=~16) or the SSRI fluoxetine (18~mg/kg/d) acutely (n~=~16), or chronically (21d, n~=~16), prior to fear conditioning. Treatment was stopped, and half of the mice (n~=~8/treatment group) were exposed to cued fear memory recall 72~h later. Activation of DR serotonergic neurons during fear conditioning (Experiment 1) or fear memory recall (Experiment 2), was measured using dual-label immunohistochemistry for Tph2 and c-Fos. Acute and chronic fluoxetine treatment reduced associative fear learning without affecting memory recall and had opposite effects on anxiety-like behaviour. Acute fluoxetine decreased serotonergic activity in the DR, while chronic treatment led to serotonergic activity that was indistinguishable from that of control levels in DRD and DRV subpopulations. Chronic fluoxetine facilitated fear extinction, which was associated with rostral DRD inhibition. These findings provide further evidence that SSRIs can alter aspects of learning and memory processes and are consistent with a role for discrete populations of DR serotonergic neurons in regulating fear- and anxiety-related behaviours.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress leads to sex-dependent outcomes on spatial memory by producing deficits in males, but not in females. Recently it was reported that compared to daily restraint, intermittent restraint (IR) produced more robust stress and anxiety responses in male rats. Whether IR would be sufficiently robust to impair hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in both male and female rats was investigated. IR involved mixing restraint with non-restraint days over weeks before assessing spatial memory and anxiety profile on the radial arm water maze, object placement, novel object recognition, Y-maze, open field and novelty suppressed feeding. Experiments 1 and 2 used Sprague-Dawley male rats only and determined that IR for 6 h/d (IR6), but not 2 h/d, impaired spatial memory and that task order was important. In experiment 3, IR6 was extended for 6wks before spatial memory testing commenced using both sexes. Unexpectedly, an extended IR6 paradigm failed to impair spatial memory in either sex, suggesting that by 6wks IR6 may have become predictable. In experiment 4, an unpredictable IR (UIR) paradigm was implemented, in which restraint duration (30 or 60-min) combined with orbital shaking, time of day, and the days off from UIR were varied. UIR impaired spatial memory in males, but not in females. Together with other reports, these findings support the interpretation that chronic stress negatively impairs hippocampal-dependent function in males, but not in females. We interpret these findings to show that females are more resilient to chronic stress than are males as it pertains to spatial ability.},

  abstract = {Reproducible science requires transparent reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved. Here, we introduce ARRIVE 2.0. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise and divide the items of the guidelines into 2 sets, the “ARRIVE Essential 10,” which constitutes the minimum requirement, and the “Recommended Set,” which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document, which serves (1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, (2) to clarify key concepts, and (3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim, through these changes, to help ensure that researchers, reviewers, and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Depression is a multifactorial mood disorder with a high prevalence worldwide. Until now, treatments for depression have focused on the inhibition of monoaminergic reuptake sites, which augment the bioavailability of monoamines in the CNS. Advances in drug discovery have widened the therapeutic options with the synthesis of so-called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine. Areas covered: The aim of this case history is to describe and discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of fluoxetine, including its acute effects and the adaptive changes induced after long-term treatment. Furthermore, the authors review the effect of fluoxetine on neuroplasticity and adult neurogenesis. In addition, the article summarises the preclinical behavioural data available on fluoxetine's effects on depressive-like behaviour, anxiety and cognition as well as its effects on other diseases. Finally, the article describes the seminal studies validating the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine. Expert opinion: Fluoxetine is the first selective SSRI that has a recognised clinical efficacy and safety profile. Since its discovery, other molecules that mimic its mechanism of action have been developed, commencing a new age in the treatment of depression. Fluoxetine has also demonstrated utility in the treatment of other disorders for which its prescription has now been approved.},

  abstract = {Chronic psychological stress is one of the most important triggers and environmental risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders. Chronic stress can influence all organs via the secretion of stress hormones, including glucocorticoids by the adrenal glands, which coordinate the stress response across the body. In the brain, glucocorticoid receptors (GR) are expressed by various cell types including microglia, which are its resident immune cells regulating stress-induced inflammatory processes. To study the roles of microglial GR under normal homeostatic conditions and following chronic stress, we generated a mouse model in which the GR gene is depleted in microglia specifically at adulthood to prevent developmental confounds. We first confirmed that microglia were depleted in GR in our model in males and females among the cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, both stress-sensitive brain regions. Then, cohorts of microglial-GR depleted and wild-type (WT) adult female mice were housed for 3 weeks in a standard or stressful condition, using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. CUMS induced stress-related behavior in both microglial-GR depleted and WT animals as demonstrated by a decrease of both saccharine preference and progressive ratio breakpoint. Nevertheless, the hippocampal microglial and neural mechanisms underlying the adaptation to stress occurred differently between the two genotypes. Upon CUMS exposure, microglial morphology was altered in the WT controls, without any apparent effect in microglial-GR depleted mice. Furthermore, in the standard environment condition, GR depleted-microglia showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in microglial homeostatic functions (such as Trem2, Cx3cr1 and Mertk). On the contrary, in CUMS condition, GR depleted-microglia showed reduced expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes and increased neuroprotective as well as anti-inflammatory genes compared to WT-microglia. Moreover, in microglial-GR depleted mice, but not in WT mice, CUMS led to a significant reduction of CA1 long-term potentiation and paired-pulse ratio. Lastly, differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis were observed between the genotypes during normal homeostatic conditions, with microglial-GR deficiency increasing the formation of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone independently from stress exposure. Together, these findings indicate that, although the deletion of microglial GR did not prevent the animal's ability to respond to stress, it contributed to modulating hippocampal functions in both standard and stressful conditions, notably by shaping the microglial response to chronic stress.},

Methods: This paper reviews four meta-analyses of efficacy trials submitted to America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and analyzes STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression), the largest antidepressant effectiveness trial ever conducted. Results: Meta-analyses of FDA trials suggest that antidepressants are only marginally efficacious compared to placebos and document profound publication bias that inflates their apparent efficacy. These meta-analyses also document a second form of bias in which researchers fail to report the negative results for the pre-specified primary outcome measure submitted to the FDA, while highlighting in published studies positive results from a secondary or even a new measure as though it was their primary measure of interest. The STAR*D analysis found that the effectiveness of antidepressant therapies was probably even lower than the modest one reported by the study authors with an apparent progressively increasing dropout rate across each study phase. Conclusions: The reviewed findings argue for a reappraisal of the current recommended standard of care of depression.},

Design The study was open label and semirandomised examining the effectiveness of up to four optimised and increasingly aggressive, antidepressant therapies in depressed adults. Patients who failed to gain adequate relief from their level 1 trial on the SSRI citalopram could receive up to three additional treatment trials in levels 2–4. Setting 41 North American psychiatry and primary care treatment centres. Participants 4041 adults screened positive for major depressive disorder. In contrast to most clinical trials, STAR*D enrolled patients seeking care (vs recruited) and included patients with a wide range of common comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions to enhance the generalisability of findings to real-world clinical practice. Interventions STAR*D evaluated the relative effectiveness of 13 antidepressants therapies in treatment levels 2–4 for depressed patients who failed to gain adequate benefit from their level 1 medication trial. Main outcome measures According to the STAR*D protocol, the primary outcome was remission, defined as a score {$<$}8 on the blinded Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Response was a secondary outcome defined as ≥50\% reduction in HRSD scores. STAR*D’s protocol specifically excluded all non-blinded clinic-administered assessments from use as research outcome measures. Results STAR*D investigators did not use the protocol-stipulated HRSD to report cumulative remission and response rates in their summary article and instead used a non-blinded clinic-administered assessment. This inflated their report of outcomes, as did their inclusion of 99 patients who scored as remitted on the HRSD at study outset as well as 125 who scored as remitted when initiating their next-level treatment. These patients should have been excluded from data analysis. In contrast to the STAR*D-reported 67\% cumulative remission rate after up to four antidepressant treatment trials, the rate was 35.0\% when using the protocol-stipulated HRSD and inclusion in data analysis criteria. Conclusion STAR*D’s cumulative remission rate was approximately half of that reported.},

We used chronic in vivo imaging and followed genetically labeled individual NSPCs and their progeny in the mouse hippocampus for up to 2 months. We show that NSPCs targeted by the endogenous Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) promoter undergo limited rounds of symmetric and asymmetric divisions, eliciting a burst of neurogenic activity, after which they are lost. Further, our data reveal unexpected asymmetric divisions of nonradial glia-like NSPCs. Cell fates of Ascl1-labeled lineages suggest a developmental-like program involving a sequential transition from a proliferative to a neurogenic phase. By providing a comprehensive description of lineage relationships, from dividing NSPCs to newborn neurons integrating into the hippocampal circuitry, our data offer insight into how NSPCs support life-long hippocampal neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {The formation of new neurons continues into adult life in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus, as in many other species. Neurogenesis itself turns out to be highly labile, and is regulated by a number of factors. One of these is the serotoninergic system: treatment with drugs (such as the SSRI fluoxetine) markedly stimulates mitosis in the progenitor cells of the dentate gyrus. But this process has one remarkable feature: it takes at least 14 days of continuous treatment to be effective. This is despite the fact that the pharmacological action of fluoxetine occurs within an hour or so of first administration. This paper explores the role of BDNF in this process, using the effect of a Trk antagonist (K252a) on the labelling of progenitor cells with the mitosis marker Ki67 and the associated expression of pCREB and Wnt3a. These experiments show that (i) Fluoxetine increased Ki67 counts, as well as pCREB and Wnt3a expression in the dentate gyrus. The action of fluoxetine on the progenitor cells and on pCREB (but not Wnt3a) depends upon Trk receptor activation, since it was prevented by icv infusion of K252a. (ii) These receptors are required for both the first 7 days of fluoxetine action, during which no apparent change in progenitor mitosis occurs, as well as the second 7 days. Increased pCREB was always associated with progenitor cell mitosis, but Wnt3a expression may be necessary but not sufficient for increased progenitor cell proliferation. These results shed new light on the action of fluoxetine on neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, and have both clinical and experimental interest.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, suicidal ideation, and reduced motivation or hopelessness. Despite considerable research, mechanisms underlying MDD remain poorly understood, and current advances in treatment are far from satisfactory. The antidepressant effect of ketamine is among the most important discoveries in psychiatric research over the last half-century. Neurobiological insights into the ketamine's effects have shed light on the mechanisms underlying antidepressant efficacy. However, mechanisms underlying the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine remain controversial. Elucidating such mechanisms is key to identifying new therapeutic targets and developing therapeutic strategies. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the contribution of the glutamatergic pathway, the major excitatory neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system, in MDD pathophysiology and antidepressant effects. The hypothesis of a connection among the calcium signaling cascade stimulated by the glutamatergic system, neural plasticity, and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription is further supported by its associations with ketamine's antidepressant effects. This review briefly summarizes the potential mechanisms of ketamine's effects with a specific focus on glutamatergic signaling from a multiscale perspective, including behavioral, cellular, molecular, and epigenetic aspects, to provide a valuable overview of ketamine's antidepressant effects.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. This situation is mainly related to the chronicity and/or recurrence of the disorder, and to poor response to antidepressant therapy. Progress in this area requires valid animal models. Current models are based either on manipulating the environment to which rodents are exposed (during the developmental period or adulthood) or biological underpinnings (i.e. gene deletion or overexpression of candidate genes, targeted lesions of brain areas, optogenetic control of specific neuronal populations, etc.). These manipulations can alter specific behavioural and biological outcomes that can be related to different symptomatic and pathophysiological dimensions of major depression. However, animal models of major depression display substantial shortcomings that contribute to the lack of innovative pharmacological approaches in recent decades and which hamper our capabilities to investigate treatment-resistant depression. Here, we discuss the validity of these models, review putative models of treatment-resistant depression, major depression subtypes and recurrent depression. Furthermore, we identify future challenges regarding new paradigms such as those proposing dimensional rather than categorical approaches to depression.},

DBA/2 mice performed more poorly than C57BL/6 mice in complex learning tasks such as the water maze and object recognition tasks. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed attenuated habituation to novelty in the open field apparatus and poorer performance in the step-down passive avoidance task. The C57BL/6 mice were less exploratory and more anxious than the DBA/2 mice. The anxiety score (open arm entries in the elevated plus maze) was significantly correlated with all measures of learning and memory in the object recognition task, and some measures in the passive avoidance and water maze tasks. Analysis of covariance (with open arm entries as a covariate) revealed that some measures on trial 1 of the object recognition task, but not the memory scores on trial 2, were confounded by anxiety. No confounding factors of anxiety were found in the water maze or passive avoidance tasks. Similar results were obtained with the activity scores (line crossing and rearing in the open field). In conclusion, strain differences in activity and anxiety did not account for strain differences in learning and memory performance of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice. Nonetheless, the importance of using complete behavioural test batteries should be stressed to ensure that strain differences in learning and memory tasks are not confounded by non-cognitive factors.},

  abstract = {To explore spatial cognition in rodents, research uses maze tasks, which differ in complexity, number of goals and pathways, behavioural flexibility, memory duration, but also in the experimenter's control over the strategy developed to reach a goal (e.g., allocentric vs. egocentric). This study aimed at validating a novel spatial memory test: the double-H maze test. The transparent device made of an alley with two opposite arms at each extremity and two in its centre is flooded. An escape platform is submerged in one arm. For experiments 1-3, rats were released in unpredictable sequences from one of both central arms to favour an allocentric approach of the task. Experiment 1 (3 trials/day over 6 days) demonstrated classical learning curves and evidence for recent and nondegraded remote memory performance. Experiment 2 (2 days, 3 trials/day) showed a dose-dependent alteration of task acquisition/consolidation by muscarinic or NMDA receptor blockade; these drug effects vanished with sustained training (experiment 3; 4 days, 3 trials/day). Experiment 4 oriented rats towards a procedural (egocentric) approach of the task. Memory was tested in a misleading probe trial. Most rats immediately switched from response learning-based to place learning-based behaviour, but only when their initial view on environmental cues markedly differed between training and probe trials. Because this simple task enables the formation of a relatively stable memory trace, it could be particularly adapted to study consolidation processes at a system level or/and the interplay between procedural and declarative-like memory systems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract screening allows the review team to conduct the tedious but vital first step to synthesize the extant literature: winnowing down the overwhelming amalgamation of citations discovered through research databases to the citations that should be “full-text” screened and eventually included in the review. Although it is a critical process, few guidelines have been put forth since the publications of seminal systematic review textbooks. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to provide a practical set of best practice guidelines to help future review teams and managers. Each of the 10 proposed guidelines is explained using real-world examples or illustrations from applications. We also delineate recent experiences where a team of abstract screeners double-screened 14 923 abstracts in 89 days.},

  abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum represents the gateway to the secretory pathway. Here, proteins destined for secretion, as well as soluble and membrane proteins that reside in the endomembrane system and plasma membrane, are triaged from proteins that will remain in the cytosol or be targeted to other cellular organelles. This process requires the faithful recognition of specific targeting signals and subsequent delivery mechanisms to then target them to the translocases present at the ER membrane, which can either translocate them into the ER lumen or insert them into the lipid bilayer. This review focuses on the current understanding of the first step in this process representing the targeting phase. Targeting is typically mediated by cleavable N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences or internal membrane anchor sequences; these can either be captured co-translationally at the ribosome or recognised post-translationally and then delivered to the ER translocases. Location and features of the targeting sequence dictate which of several overlapping targeting pathway substrates will be used. Mutations in the targeting machinery or targeting signals can be linked to diseases.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress induces anhedonia in susceptible but not resilient individuals, a phenomenon observed in humans as well as animal models, but the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience are not well understood. We hypothesized that the serotonergic system, which is implicated in stress, reward, and antidepressant therapy, may play a role. We found that plasticity of the serotonergic system contributes to the differential vulnerability to stress displayed by susceptible and resilient animals. Stress-induced anhedonia was assessed in adult male rats using social defeat and intracranial self-stimulation, while changes in serotonergic phenotype were investigated using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Susceptible, but not resilient, rats displayed an increased number of neurons expressing the biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin, tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), in the ventral subnucleus of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRv). Further, a decrease in the number of DRv glutamatergic (VGLUT3+) neurons was observed in all stressed rats. This neurotransmitter plasticity is activity-dependent, as was revealed by chemogenetic manipulation of the central amygdala, a stress-sensitive nucleus that forms a major input to the DR. Activation of amygdalar corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)+ neurons abolished the increase in DRv TPH2+ neurons and ameliorated stress-induced anhedonia in susceptible rats. These findings show that activation of amygdalar CRH+ neurons induces resilience, and suppresses the gain of serotonergic phenotype in the DRv that is characteristic of susceptible rats. This molecular signature of vulnerability to stress-induced anhedonia and the active nature of resilience could be targeted to develop new treatments for stress-related disorders like depression. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Depression and other mental disorders can be induced by chronic or traumatic stressors. However, some individuals are resilient and do not develop depression in response to chronic stress. A complete picture of the molecular differences between susceptible and resilient individuals is necessary to understand how plasticity of limbic circuits is associated with the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Using a rodent model, our study identifies a novel molecular marker of susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, and a means to modulate it. These findings will guide further investigation into cellular and circuit mechanisms of resilience, and the development of new treatments for depression.},

In this paper we consider the evidence to suggest that early changes in emotional processing underlie subsequent mood improvement following antidepressant treatment. Negative biases in information processing are consistently found in depression, and we argue that primary mode of action of antidepressant drugs may be to remediate these biases providing a more positive social environment in which the patient can relearn emotional associations fostering later improvement in mood. Evidence from behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies supports this hypothesis. Experimental medicine models developed under this premise have the potential to screen for new treatments, to predict individual treatment response and to consider the effects of pharmacological vs psychological treatments. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder is the most prevalent psychiatric condition, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder are largely unknown, although multiple hypotheses have been proposed. The aim of this study was to characterize the progressive alteration of neuronal plasticity in the male rat hippocampus during depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), an established animal model of depression. The data in the hippocampus were collected on days 7, 14 and 21 after the onset of three-week CUMS. When analyzed on day 21, three-week CUMS induced typically depressive-like behaviors, impaired LTP induction, and decreased basal synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses recorded in vivo, which was accompanied by decreased density of dendritic spines in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. The levels of both Kalirin-7 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were decreased at the same time. On day 14 (middle phase), some depressive-like behaviors were observed, which was accompanied by depressed basal synaptic transmission and enhanced LTP induction at the CA3-CA1 synapses. However, BDNF expression was decreased without alteration of Kalirin7 expression in comparison with no-stress control. Depressed basal synaptic transmission occurred in the middle phase of CUMS may contribute to decreased expression of BDNF. On day 7, depressive-like behaviors were not observed, and LTP induction, spine density, Kalirin-7 and BDNF expression were not altered by CUMS in comparison with no-stress control. These results showed that the functional changes at CA3-CA1synapses occurred earlier than the structural alteration during three-week CUMS as a strategy of neural adaptation, and rats required three weeks to develop depressive-like behaviors during CUMS. Our results suggest an important role of Kalirin-7 in CUMS-mediated alterations in spine density, synaptic function and overall depressive-like behaviors on day 21.},

  abstract = {Depression, a severe psychiatric disorder, has been studied for decades, but the underlying mechanisms still remain largely unknown. Depression is closely associated with alterations in dendritic spine morphology and spine density. Therefore, understanding dendritic spines is vital for uncovering the mechanisms underlying depression. Several chronic stress models, including chronic restraint stress (CRS), chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), have been used to recapitulate depression-like behaviors in rodents and study the underlying mechanisms. In comparison with CRS, CUMS overcomes the stress habituation and has been widely used to model depression-like behaviors. CSDS is one of the most frequently used models for depression, but it is limited to the study of male mice. Generally, chronic stress causes dendritic atrophy and spine loss in the neurons of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Meanwhile, neurons of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens exhibit an increase in spine density. These alterations induced by chronic stress are often accompanied by depression-like behaviors. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This review summarizes our current understanding of the chronic stress-induced remodeling of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens and also discusses the putative underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells normally grow on soft surfaces due to impaired mechanosensing of the extracellular matrix rigidity. Upon restoration of proper mechanosensing, cancer cells undergo apoptosis on soft surfaces (anoikis) like most normal cells. However, the link between mechanosensing and activation of anoikis is not clear. Here we show that death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a tumor suppressor that activates cell death, is directly linked to anoikis activation through rigidity sensing. We find that when rigidity sensing is decreased through inhibition of DAPK1 activity, cells are transformed for growth on soft matrices. Further, DAPK1 catalyzes matrix adhesion assembly and is part of adhesions on rigid surfaces. This pathway involves DAPK1 phosphorylation of tropomyosin1.1, the talin1 head domain, and tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPK1 by Src. On soft surfaces, DAPK1 rapidly dissociates from the adhesion complexes and activates apoptosis as catalyzed by PTPN12 activity and talin1 head. Thus, DAPK1 is important for adhesion assembly on rigid surfaces and the activation of anoikis on soft surfaces through its binding to rigidity-sensing modules.},

Nevertheless, no detailed and systematic study has been conducted to identify which differentiation stages of mDA cells are most suitable for transplantation in PD therapy. Here, we transplanted three types of mDA cells, DA progenitors (differentiated in vitro for 16 days [D16]), immature DA neurons (D25), and DA neurons (D35), into PD mice and found that all three types of cells showed high viability and strong neuronal differentiation in vivo. Both D25 and D35 cells showed neuronal maturation and differentiation toward TH+ cells and, accordingly, satisfactory behavioral functional recovery. However, transplanted D16 cells were less capable of producing functional recovery. These findings provide a valuable guideline for standardizing the differentiation stage of the transplantable cells used in clinical cell therapy for PD.},

  abstract = {The ability to adapt to new situations involves behavioral changes expressed either from an innate repertoire, or by acquiring experience through memory consolidation mechanisms, by far a much richer and flexible source of adaptation. Memory formation consists of two interrelated processes that take place at different spatial and temporal scales, Synaptic Consolidation, local plastic changes in the recruited neurons, and Systems Consolidation, a process of gradual reorganization of the explicit/declarative memory trace between hippocampus and the neocortex. In this review, we summarize some converging experimental results from our lab that support a normal temporal framework of memory systems consolidation as measured both from the anatomical and the psychological points of view, and propose a hypothetical model that explains these findings while predicting other phenomena. Then, the same experimental design was repeated interposing additional tasks between the training and the remote test to verify for any interference: we found that (a) when the animals were subject to a succession of new learnings, systems consolidation was accelerated, with the disengagement of the hippocampus taking place before the natural time point of this functional switch, but (b) when a few reactivation sessions reexposed the animal to the training context without the shock, systems consolidation was delayed, with the hippocampus prolonging its involvement in retrieval. We hypothesize that new learning recruits from a fixed number of plastic synapses in the CA1 area to store the engram index, while reconsolidation lead to a different outcome, in which additional synapses are made available. The first situation implies the need of a reset mechanism in order to free synapses needed for further learning, and explains the acceleration observed under intense learning activity, while the delay might be explained by a different process, able to generate extra free synapses: depending on the cognitive demands, it deals either with a fixed or a variable pool of available synapses. The Synaptic Occupancy/Reset Theory (SORT) emerged as an explanation for the temporal flexibility of systems consolidation, to encompass the two different dynamics of explicit memories, as well as to bridge both synaptic and systems consolidation in one single mechanism.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent reports have criticized the design of antidepressant studies and have questioned their validity. These critics have concluded that antidepressants are no better than placebo treatment and that their illusory superiority depends on methodologically flawed studies and biased clinical evaluations. It has been suggested that the blind in randomized trials is penetrable—since clinician’s guesses exceed chance—and that only active placebo can appropriately camouflage the difference between drug and placebo response. Furthermore, evidence has been cited to suggest that psychotherapy is as effective as antidepressants in both the acute and maintenance treatment of depression. These positions are often accepted as valid and have been broadly discussed in both the lay press and scientific literature. The purpose of this review is to reassess the cited data that support these assertions. METHOD: The authors examined the specific studies that were cited in these reports, evaluated their methodology, and conducted aggregate analyses. RESULTS: Analyses of the original sources failed to substantiate 1) that standard antidepressants are no more effective than placebo, 2) that active placebo offers an advantage over inactive placebo, or 3) that substantial evidence of a medication bias is suggested by raters’ treatment guesses exceeding chance. The authors also note that some researchers have suggested that the interpretation of psychotherapy trials can be complicated by “allegiance effects.” CONCLUSIONS: The issue of bias or allegiance effects for both antidepressant and psychotherapy research is real. Investigators of all orientations must guard against potential bias. However, studies cited as supporting the questionable validity of antidepressant trials fail upon closer examination to support assertions that these trials are invalid.},

Long-Evans rats were trained to dig in cups that contained distinct odors. In the odor discrimination, one odor cup contained a cereal reinforcement in acquisition whereas a different odor cup contained a cereal reinforcement in reversal learning. The other 2 odor cups were never associated with reinforcement. Bilateral infusions of the gamma aminobutyric acid-A agonist muscimol did not impair acquisition of the odor discrimination but impaired reversal learning in a dose-dependent manner. During reversal learning, dorsal anterior cingulate inactivation did not lead to perseveration but selectively increased errors to the odor cups that were never reinforced. These findings suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate supports learning when conditions require a shift in choice patterns and may enhance cognitive flexibility by decreasing interference of irrelevant stimuli.

  abstract = {Understanding how knowledge about the world is represented within model-free deep reinforcement learning methods is a major challenge given the black box nature of its learning process within high-dimensional observation and action spaces. AlphaStar and OpenAI Five have shown that agents can be trained without any explicit hierarchical macro-actions to reach superhuman skill in games that require taking thousands of actions before reaching the final goal. Assessing the agent's plans and game understanding becomes challenging given the lack of hierarchy or explicit representations of macro-actions in these models, coupled with the incomprehensible nature of the internal representations. In this paper, we study the distributed representations learned by OpenAI Five to investigate how game knowledge is gradually obtained over the course of training. We also introduce a general technique for learning a model from the agent's hidden states to identify the formation of plans and subgoals. We show that the agent can learn situational similarity across actions, and find evidence of planning towards accomplishing subgoals minutes before they are executed. We perform a qualitative analysis of these predictions during the games against the DotA 2 world champions OG in April 2019.},

  abstract = {The present paper reviews astrocyte pathology in major depressive disorder (MDD) and proposes that reductions in astrocytes and related markers are key features in the pathology of MDD. Astrocytes are the most numerous and versatile of all types of glial cells. They are crucial to the neuronal microenvironment by regulating glucose metabolism, neurotransmitter uptake (particularly for glutamate), synaptic development and maturation and the blood brain barrier. Pathology of astrocytes has been consistently noted in MDD as well as in rodent models of depressive-like behavior. This review summarizes evidence from human postmortem tissue showing alterations in the expression of protein and mRNA for astrocyte markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), gap junction proteins (connexin 40 and 43), the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a calcium-binding protein S100B and glutamatergic markers including the excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT1, EAAT2) and glutamine synthetase. Moreover, preclinical studies are presented that demonstrate the involvement of GFAP and astrocytes in animal models of stress and depressive-like behavior and the influence of different classes of antidepressant medications on astrocytes. In light of the various astrocyte deficits noted in MDD, astrocytes may be novel targets for the action of antidepressant medications. Possible functional consequences of altered expression of astrocytic markers in MDD are also discussed. Finally, the unique pattern of cell pathology in MDD, characterized by prominent reductions in the density of astrocytes and in the expression of their markers without obvious neuronal loss, is contrasted with that found in other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.},

Their many metabolic interactions with each other, and with the human host, influence human nutrition and metabolism in diverse ways. Our understanding of these influences has come through breakthroughs in the molecular profiling of the phylogeny and the metabolic capacities of the microbiota. The gut microbiota produce a variety of nutrients including short-chain fatty acids, B vitamins, and vitamin K. Because of their ability to interact with receptors on epithelial cells and subepithelial cells, the microbiota also release a number of cellular factors that influence human metabolism. Thus, they have potential roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cognition, which extend well beyond their traditional contribution to nutrition. This review explores the roles of the gut microbiota in human nutrition and metabolism, and the putative mechanisms underlying these effects.},

Ketamine treatment activates ABINs in parallel with its behavioral effects in both stressed and unstressed mice. Chemogenetic inhibition of ABIN activity blocks the antidepressant effects of ketamine, indicating that this activity is necessary for the behavioral effects. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of ABINs without any change in neuron numbers mimics both the cellular and the behavioral effects of ketamine, indicating that increased activity of ABINs is sufficient for rapid antidepressant effects. These findings thus identify a specific cell population that mediates the antidepressant actions of ketamine, indicating that ABINs can potentially be targeted to limit ketamine’s side effects while preserving its therapeutic efficacy.},

In the 20th century, mechanisms of action were demonstrated with the discovery of its active substances, the phytocannabinoids, and its pharmacological targets, the endocannabinoid system. This system is composed of receptors, endogenous substances, and enzymes, and it participates in the modulation of physiological mechanisms in several species, including dogs. Studies indicate that changes in this system may contribute to the genesis of some diseases. Therefore, the use of substances that act on its components may help in the treatment of these diseases. The main phytocannabinoids described are Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). In humans, the benefits of using CBD in several diseases have been demonstrated. The popularization of this type of treatment has also reached veterinary medicine, which on one hand was related to an increase in adverse event records, but on the other also allowed reports of anecdotal evidences of its effectiveness and safety in animals. Clinical studies published so far indicate that the use of CBD in dogs can be safe at given doses and can contribute to osteoarthritis and idiopathic epilepsy treatments. Clinical and pre-clinical studies and case reports were reviewed in this report to identify the main characteristics of hemp-based therapies in dogs, including its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy in the treatment of diseases.},

Once released, these adrenal steroids mediate a plethora of physiological responses in both the periphery and the central nervous system. The collective actions of GCs in the brain are paradoxical, however, in that basal levels of GCs are essential for neuronal development, plasticity and survival, while stress levels of GCs produce neuronal loss. Aging represents another contradictory function of GCs in the brain, since lifelong exposure to GCs has been implicated as a causative factor in senescent neuronal loss. In addition, glucocorticoids have also been shown to intensify neuronal damage in the hippocampus during ischemia and excitotoxicity through mechanisms that modulate synaptic glutamate concentrations. Conversely, the absence of adrenal steroids has been shown to regulate both neurogenesis and neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Evidence continues to accumulate which suggests that GC-induced neuronal death in all these physiological and pathophysiological settings occurs by apoptosis. Accordingly, this review will examine the pharmacological, cellular and molecular mechanisms through which glucocorticoids mediate or contribute to neuronal remodeling and, ultimately, neuronal death.},

  abstract = {Guidelines for color use in quantitative visualizations have strongly discouraged the use of rainbow colormaps, arguing instead for smooth designs that do not induce visual discontinuities or implicit color categories. However, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. In practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. We study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. We first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. We hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. In three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). Conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. Participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. Our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. In addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful.

  abstract = {Our purpose in this investigation was to determine if we could reduce cage changing frequency without adversely affecting the health of mice. We housed mice at three different cage changing frequencies: 7, 14, and 21 days, each at three different cage ventilation rates: 30, 60 and 100 air changes per hour (ACH), for a total of nine experimental conditions. For each condition, we evaluated the health of 12 breeding pairs and 12 breeding trios of C57BL/6J mice for 7 months. Health was assessed by breeding performance, weanling weight and growth, plasma corticosterone levels, immune function, and histological examination of selected organs. Over a period of 4 months, we monitored the cage microenvironment for ammonia and carbon dioxide concentrations, relative humidity, and temperature one day prior to changing the cage. The relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentrations, and temperature of the cages at all conditions were within acceptable levels. Ammonia concentrations remained below 25 ppm (parts per million) in most cages, but, even at higher concentrations, did not adversely affect the health of mice. Frequency of cage changing had only one significant effect; pup mortality with pair matings was greater at the cage changing frequency of 7 days compared with 14 or 21 days. In addition, pup mortality with pair matings was higher at 30 ACH compared with other ventilation rates. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, cage changes once every 14 days and ventilation rates of 60 ACH provide optimum conditions for animal health and practical husbandry.},

  abstract = {Relating stimulus properties to the response properties of individual neurons and neuronal networks is a major goal of sensory research. Many investigators implant electrode arrays in multiple brain areas and record from chronically implanted electrodes over time to answer a variety of questions. Technical challenges related to analyzing large-scale neuronal recording data are not trivial. Several analysis methods traditionally used by neurophysiologists do not account for dependencies in the data that are inherent in multi-electrode recordings. In addition, when neurophysiological data are not best modeled by the normal distribution and when the variables of interest may not be linearly related, extensions of the linear modeling techniques are recommended. A variety of methods exist to analyze correlated data, even when the data are not normally distributed and the relationships are nonlinear. Here we review expansions of the Generalized Linear Model designed to address these data properties. Such methods are used in other research fields, and the application to large-scale neuronal recording data will enable investigators to determine the variable properties that convincingly contribute to the variances in the observed neuronal measures. Standard measures of neuron properties such as response magnitudes can be analyzed using these methods, and measures of neuronal network activity such as spike timing correlations can be analyzed as well. We have done just that in recordings from 100-electrode arrays implanted in the primary somatosensory cortex of owl monkeys. Here we illustrate how one example method, Generalized Estimating Equations analysis, is a useful method to apply to large-scale neuronal recordings.},

  abstract = {Targeted mutagenesis of the glucocorticoid receptor has revealed an essential function for survival and the regulation of multiple physiological processes. To investigate the effects of an increased gene dosage of the receptor, we have generated transgenic mice carrying two additional copies of the glucocorticoid receptor gene by using a yeast artificial chromosome. Interestingly, overexpression of the glucocorticoid receptor alters the basal regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in reduced expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotrope hormone and a fourfold reduction in the level of circulating glucocorticoids. In addition, primary thymocytes obtained from transgenic mice show an enhanced sensitivity to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Finally, analysis of these mice under challenge conditions revealed that expression of the glucocorticoid receptor above wild-type levels leads to a weaker response to restraint stress and a strongly increased resistance to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock. These results underscore the importance of tight regulation of glucocorticoid receptor expression for the control of physiological and pathological processes. Furthermore, they may explain differences in the susceptibility of humans to inflammatory diseases and stress, depending on individual prenatal and postnatal experiences known to influence the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor.},

We generated novel intersectional viral-genetic tools to access specific subpopulations. Whole-brain axonal projection mapping revealed that DR serotonin neurons co-expressing vesicular glutamate transporter-3 preferentially innervate the cortex, whereas those co-expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone innervate subcortical regions in particular the hypothalamus. Reconstruction of 50 individual DR serotonin neurons revealed segregated axonal projection patterns at the single-cell level. Together, these results provide a molecular foundation of the heterogenous serotonin neuronal phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Besides demonstrated efficacy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) hold other advantages over earlier antidepressants such as greater tolerability and a wider range of clinical applications. However, there is a growing body of clinical evidence which suggests that SSRIs could, in some cases, be associated with a withdrawal reaction upon cessation of regular use. In addition to sensory and gastrointestinal-related symptoms, the somatic symptoms of the SSRI discontinuation syndrome include dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances. Psychological symptoms have also been documented, usually developing within 1–7\,days following SSRI discontinuation. The characteristics of the discontinuation syndrome have been linked to the half-life of a given SSRI, with a greater number of reports emerging from paroxetine compared to other SSRIs. However, many aspects of the neurobiology of the SSRI discontinuation syndrome (or SSRI withdrawal syndrome) remain unresolved. Following a comprehensive overview of the clinical evidence, we will discuss the underlying pathophysiology of the SSRI discontinuation syndrome and comment on the use of animal models to better understand this condition.},

  abstract = {For four decades, norepinephrine (NE) has been postulated to play an important, possibly primary, role in the pathophysiology and subsequent treatment of mood disorders. The long-held hypothesis was that depression and pathological elation are direct functions of low and high activity of norepinephrine-containing neurons, respectively. Decades of research in this field have been devoted to further clarifying this relationship. However, there continues to be inconsistencies in the data, with different studies finding significant differences in NE metabolites and changes in receptor populations. Furthermore, antidepressants that do not act directly on the NE system appear to be quite effective in the treatment of depression. Although differential NE activity and treatment response may be partially due to different subtypes of depression, this clearly does not explain all the data. This review attempts to consolidate the relevant physiology of the NE system with the pathological changes found in depression. Norepinephrine clearly has an important role in this disease, but absolute changes in its activity are less likely to be the primary cause of the disorder. Evidence for dysregulation of the locus ceruleus-NE system in depression is quite apparent, however, contributing to disrupted attention, concentration, memory, arousal, and sleep. Homeostatic changes likely occur after chronic treatment with antidepressants, allowing a new regulatory state to occur in which NE modulation is once again effective. The availability of new tools such as selective ligands for the NE transporter that can be utilized with positron emission tomography imaging will undoubtedly advance the field.},

  abstract = {Two receptor systems for corticosterone (CORT) can be distinguished in rat brain: mineralocorticoid-like or CORT receptors (CR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR). The microdistribution and extent of occupation of each receptor population by CORT were studied. The CR system is restricted predominantly to the lateral septum and hippocampus. Within the hippocampus, the highest density occurs in the subiculum +/- CA1 cell field (144 fmol/mg protein) and the dentate gyrus (104 fmol/mg protein). Affinity of CR for CORT was very high (Kd, approximately 0.5 nM). The GR system has a more widespread distribution in the brain. The highest density for GR is in the lateral septum (195 fmol/mg protein), the dentate gyrus (133 fmol/mg protein), the nucleus tractus solitarii and central amygdala. Substantial amounts of GR are present in the paraventricular nucleus and locus coeruleus and low amounts in the raphe area and the subiculum + CA1 cell field. The affinity of GR for CORT (Kd, approximately 2.5-5 nM) was 6- to 10-fold lower than that of CR. Occupation of CR by endogenous ligand was 89.5\% during morning trough levels of pituitary-adrenal activity (plasma CORT, 1.4 micrograms/100 ml). Similar levels of occupation (88.7\% and 97.6\%) were observed at the diurnal peak (plasma CORT, 27 micrograms/100 ml) and after 1 h of restraint stress (plasma CORT, 25 micrograms/100 ml), respectively. Furthermore, a dose of 1 microgram CORT/100 g BW, sc, resulted in 80\% CORT receptor occupation, whereas GR were not occupied. For 50\% occupation of GR, doses needed to be increased to 50-100 micrograms/100 g BW, and for 95\% occupation, a dose of 1 mg CORT was required. The plasma CORT level at the time of half-maximal GR occupation was about 25 micrograms/100 ml, which is in the range of levels attained after stress or during the diurnal peak of pituitary-adrenal activity. Thus, CR are extensively filled (greater than 90\%) with endogenous CORT under most circumstances, while GR become occupied concurrent with increasing plasma CORT concentrations due to stress or diurnal rhythm. We conclude that CORT action via CR may be involved in a tonic (permissive) influence on brain function with the septohippocampal complex as a primary target. In view of the almost complete occupation of CR by endogenous hormones, the regulation of the CORT signal via CR will, most likely, be by alterations in the number of such receptors. In contrast, CORT action via GR is involved in its feedback action on stress-activated brain mechanisms, and GR occur widely in the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones play a pivotal role in the response to stressful challenges. The surge in glucocorticoid hormone secretion after stress needs to be tightly controlled with characteristics like peak height, curvature and duration depending on the nature and severity of the challenge. This is important as chronic hyper- or hypo-responses are detrimental to health due to increasing the risk for developing a stress-related mental disorder. Proper glucocorticoid responses to stress are critical for adaptation. Therefore, the tight control of baseline and stress-evoked glucocorticoid secretion are important constituents of an organism's resilience. Here, we address a number of mechanisms that illustrate the multitude and complexity of measures safeguarding the control of glucocorticoid function. These mechanisms include the control of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) occupancy and concentration, the dynamic control of free glucocorticoid hormone availability by corticosteroidbinding globulin (CBG), and the control exerted by glucocorticoids at the signaling, epigenetic and genomic level on gene transcriptional responses to stress. We review the beneficial effects of regular exercise on HPA axis and sleep physiology, and cognitive and anxiety-related behavior. Furthermore, we describe that, possibly through changes in the GABAergic system, exercise reduces the impact of stress on a signaling pathway specifically in the dentate gyrus that is strongly implicated in the behavioral response to that stressor. These observations underline the impact of life style on stress resilience. Finally, we address how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting glucocorticoid action can compromise stress resilience, which becomes most apparent under conditions of childhood abuse.},

  abstract = {Studies have pointed to a relationship between MAPK kinase (MEK) signaling and the behavioral effects of antidepressant drugs. So, in the present study we examined the behavioral and molecular effects of ketamine, an antagonist of the N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDA), which has been shown to have an antidepressant effect after the inhibition of MEK signaling in Wistar rats. Our results showed that acute administration of the MEK inhibitor PD184161, produced depressive-like behavior and stopped antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in the forced swimming test. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK 1/2) was decreased by PD184161 in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, and the effects of ketamine on pERK 1/2 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were inhibited by PD184161. The ERK 2 levels were decreased by PD184161 in the nucleus accumbens; and the effects of ketamine were blocked in this brain area. The p38 protein kinase (p38MAPK) and proBDNF were inhibited by PD184161, and the MEK inhibitor prevented the effects of ketamine in the nucleus accumbens. In addition, ketamine increased pro-BDNF levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that an acute blockade of MAPK signaling lead to depressive-like behavior and stopped the antidepressant response of ketamine, suggesting that the effects of ketamine could be mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of MAPK signaling in these specific brain areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Recent studies combining pharmacological, behavioral, electrophysiological and molecular approaches indicate that depression results from maladaptive neuroplastic processes occurring in defined frontolimbic circuits responsible for emotional processing such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and ventral striatum. However, the exact mechanisms controlling synaptic plasticity that are disrupted to trigger depressive conditions have not been elucidated. Since glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) tightly and dynamically interact with synapses, engaging a bi-directional communication critical for the processing of synaptic information, we now revisit the role of glial cells in the etiology of depression focusing on a dysfunction of the “quad-partite” synapse. This interest is supported by the observations that depressive-like conditions are associated with a decreased density and hypofunction of astrocytes and with an increased microglia “activation” in frontolimbic regions, which is expected to contribute for the synaptic dysfunction present in depression. Furthermore, the traditional culprits of depression (glucocorticoids, biogenic amines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) affect glia functioning, whereas antidepressant treatments (serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, electroshocks, deep brain stimulation) recover glia functioning. In this context of a quad-partite synapse, systems modulating glia-synapse bidirectional communication—such as the purinergic neuromodulation system operated by adenosine 50-triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine—emerge as promising candidates to “re-normalize” synaptic function by combining direct synaptic effects with an ability to also control astrocyte and microglia function. This proposed triple action of purines to control aberrant synaptic function illustrates the rationale to consider the interference with glia dysfunction as a mechanism of action driving the design of future pharmacological tools to manage depression.},

  abstract = {Background. The term ‘distress’ is frequently used in nursing literature to describe patient discomfort related to signs and symptoms of acute or chronic illness, pre- or post-treatment anxiety or compromised status of fetuses or the respiratory system. ‘Psychological distress’ may more accurately describe the patient condition to which nurses respond than does the term ‘distress’. Psychological distress is seldom defined as a distinct concept and is often embedded in the context of strain, stress and distress. This creates confusion for nurses attempting to manage the care of people experiencing psychological distress. Aims. This paper is a concept analysis of psychological distress based on Walker and Avant's (1995) criteria that identifies the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of psychological distress based upon the findings of the literature review. In addition, empirical references are identified and constructed cases presented. Methods. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid, PsychINFO, and Cancer Lit databases over the last 50 years. The purposes of this concept analysis were: (1) to establish the concept of psychological distress as a clear and distinct concept, separate from strain, stress and distress, and (2) to provide nurses with a base of knowledge from which to plan effective clinical interventions. Findings. Content analysis of the literature revealed that, although used frequently in health care literature, the origin of the concept of psychological distress has not been clearly articulated and is ill-defined. Conclusions. Psychological distress is a serious problem faced by many of the people whom nurses encounter on a daily basis. An understanding of the concept of psychological distress will help nurses ameliorate this problem in patients. Nursing research related to the exploration of psychological distress is also needed.},

The present observational meta-research study examined how often scientists in different fields use various graph types, and assessed whether visualization practices have changed between 2010 and 2020. We developed and validated an automated screening tool, designed to identify bar graphs of counts or proportions, bar graphs of continuous data, bar graphs with dot plots, dot plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, and flow charts. Papers from 23 fields (approximately 1000 papers/field per year) were randomly selected from PubMed Central and screened (n=227998). F1 scores for different graphs ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 in the internal validation set. While the tool also performed well in external validation sets, F1 scores were lower for uncommon graphs. Bar graphs are more often used incorrectly to display continuous data than they are used correctly to display counts or proportions. The proportion of papers that use bar graphs of continuous data varies markedly across fields (range in 2020: 4-58\%), with high rates in biochemistry and cell biology, complementary and alternative medicine, physiology, genetics, oncology and carcinogenesis, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Visualization practices have improved in some fields in recent years. Fewer than 25\% of papers use flow charts, which provide information about attrition and the risk of bias. The present study highlights the need for continued interventions to improve visualization and identifies fields that would benefit most.},

Animal models were then developed based on the ability of these drugs to alter specific behaviours. These models have played a major role in the development of the second generation of antidepressants. However, their use has been heavily criticized, particularly in relation to whether they recapitulate similar underlying biology to the psychiatric disorder they are proposed to represent. This article considers our work in the field of affective bias and the development of a translational research programme to try to develop and validate better animal models. We discuss whether the new data that have arisen from these studies support an alternative perspective on the underlying neurobiological processes that lead to major depressive disorder (MDD). Specifically, this article will consider whether a neuropsychological mechanism involving affective biases plays a causal role in the development of MDD and its associated emotional and behavioural symptoms. These animal studies also raise the possibility that neuropsychological mechanisms involving affective biases are a precursor to, rather than a consequence of, the neurotrophic changes linked to MDD.},

Varying hippocampal volume definition is a well-established problem in this field. Given that hippocampal function can be mapped onto anatomically defined substructures and that detailed examination of substructure volumes is now possible, we examined different hippocampal composite measures in MDD to look for hippocampal markers of MDD. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were compared between 80 patients with a range of MDD duration and 83 healthy control subjects. High-resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted–fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images were examined using the automated hippocampal substructure module in FreeSurfer 6.0. Between-group volumetric assessments were performed at substructure and composite substructures levels. Results Patients with MDD showed a bilateral pattern of volume reduction in principal hippocampal substructures: the cornu ammonis (CA1–CA4), dentate gyrus, and subiculum. Changes were more pronounced on the left of these structures and in recurrent depression. CA2 to CA4 were the only substructures reduced in first-presentation depression. Overall changes were most marked in the left CA1, and CA1 volume was a predictor of illness duration. Conclusions Hippocampal involvement in MDD is confined to principal substructures only. Differences between patients with MDD and healthy control subjects increased with progressively restricted hippocampal definitions, with the left CA1 emerging as a potential marker of MDD. Changes were more extensive in patients with recurrent, as opposed to first-presentation, MDD, suggesting a hippocampal disease process. These findings identify core hippocampal regions in the pathology of MDD, suggesting a potential marker of disease progression in MDD.},

This review compiles findings from several decades of research investigating the role of the amygdala in modulating memories of emotional experiences. Episodic memory is a kind of declarative memory that depends upon the hippocampus, and studies suggest that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) modulates episodic memory consolidation through interactions with the hippocampus. Although many studies in rodents and imaging studies in humans indicate that the amygdala modulates memory consolidation and plasticity processes in the hippocampus, the anatomical pathways through which the amygdala affects hippocampal regions that are important for episodic memories were unresolved until recent optogenetic advances made it possible to visualize and manipulate specific BLA efferent pathways during memory consolidation. Findings indicate that the BLA influences hippocampal-dependent memories, as well as synaptic plasticity, histone modifications, gene expression, and translation of synaptic plasticity associated proteins in the hippocampus. More recent findings from optogenetic studies suggest that the BLA modulates spatial memory via projections to the medial entorhinal cortex, and that the frequency of activity in this pathway is a critical element of this modulation.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

  abstract = {Cognitive abnormalities are a core feature of depression, and biases toward negatively toned emotional information are common, but are they a cause or a consequence of depressive symptoms? Here, we propose a cognitive neuropsychological model of depression, suggesting that negative information processing biases have a central causal role in the development of symptoms of depression, and that treatments exert their beneficial effects by abolishing these biases. We review the evidence pertaining to this model: briefly with respect to currently depressed patients, and in more detail with respect to individuals at risk for depression and the effects of antidepressant treatments. As well as being present in currently depressed individuals, negative biases are detectable in those vulnerable for depression due to neuroticism, genetic risk, or previous depressive illness. Recent evidence provides strong support for the notion that both antidepressant drugs and psychological therapies modify negative biases, providing a common mechanism for understanding treatments for depression. Intriguingly, it may even be possible to predict which patients will benefit most from which treatments on the basis of neural responses to negative stimuli. However, further research is required to ascertain whether negative processing biases will be useful in predicting, detecting, and treating depression, and hence in preventing a chronic, relapsing course of illness. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

The CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial associations between any spatial location (place in rodents or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The theory is extended to associations between time and object or reward to implement temporal order memory, also important in episodic memory. The dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by competitive learning to produce sparse representations, producing for example neurons with place-like fields from entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule cells produce by the very small number of mossy fibre connections to CA3 a randomizing pattern separation effect important during learning but not recall that separates out the patterns represented by CA3 firing to be very different from each other, which is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory system in which each memory must be kept distinct from other memories. The direct perforant path input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate to provide the cue for recall in CA3, but not for learning. The CA1 recodes information from CA3 to set up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, providing a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical and neocortical–neocortical backprojections. Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion analyses and hippocampal NMDA receptor knockouts are described and support the theory.},

  abstract = {The concept of a (single) limbic system is shown to be outmoded. Instead, anatomical, neurophysiological, functional neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence is described that anterior limbic and related structures including the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in emotion, reward valuation, and reward-related decision-making (but not memory), with the value representations transmitted to the anterior cingulate cortex for action–outcome learning. In this ‘emotion limbic system’ a computational principle is that feedforward pattern association networks learn associations from visual, olfactory and auditory stimuli, to primary reinforcers such as taste, touch, and pain. In primates including humans this learning can be very rapid and rule-based, with the orbitofrontal cortex overshadowing the amygdala in this learning important for social and emotional behaviour. Complementary evidence is described showing that the hippocampus and limbic structures to which it is connected including the posterior cingulate cortex and the fornix-mammillary body-anterior thalamus-posterior cingulate circuit are involved in episodic or event memory, but not emotion. This ‘hippocampal system’ receives information from neocortical areas about spatial location, and objects, and can rapidly associate this information together by the different computational principle of autoassociation in the CA3 region of the hippocampus involving feedback. The system can later recall the whole of this information in the CA3 region from any component, a feedback process, and can recall the information back to neocortical areas, again a feedback (to neocortex) recall process. Emotion can enter this memory system from the orbitofrontal cortex etc., and be recalled back to the orbitofrontal cortex etc. during memory recall, but the emotional and hippocampal networks or ‘limbic systems’ operate by different computational principles, and operate independently of each other except insofar as an emotional state or reward value attribute may be part of an episodic memory.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

The objective of this study was to determine how bedding volume and the interval between changes affect microenvironmental conditions, health, and behavior of mice housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC). A total of 15 cages (n = 5 cages per bedding volume) housing ICR female mice (n = 5 animals per cage) were monitored for 17 d. Parameters monitored included clinical evaluation of each animal, appearance of the cage, fecal corticosterone levels, bedding weight, and mouse mass. Atmospheric analysis was performed daily to determine intracage ammonia cage humidity and temperature on a daily basis. Mice were videotaped for 10 min on days 1, 8, and 15, and videos were analyzed for abnormal behaviors. On day 17, 1 mouse from each cage was euthanized, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Statistical differences in parameters were most often noted between low- and high-volume bedding groups. Correlation between visual appearance and actual intracage environmental conditions and mouse health and behavior at specific time points indicated cages that appear dirty to most observers did not have measurably adverse effects on the animals for any of the many parameters evaluated in this study. This study demonstrated that a 2-wk interval between cage changes for ICR female mice housed in IVC caging (with approximately 90 air changes per hour) and aspen chip bedding did not significantly affect measures of animal well-being in this study. This lack of effect occurred despite the appearance of excessive soiling by the 2-wk time point.},

This approach documents all steps of analysis, which can be shared in easily readable formats including PDF, HTML, and a web-based computer environment (an example provided) capable of regenerating the analysis directly from raw data., Neurophysiology requires an extensive workflow of information analysis routines, which often includes incompatible proprietary software, introducing limitations based on financial costs, transfer of data between platforms, and the ability to share. An ecosystem of free open-source software exists to fill these gaps, including thousands of analysis and plotting packages written in Python and R, which can be implemented in a sharable and reproducible format, such as the Jupyter electronic notebook. This tool chain can largely replace current routines by importing data, producing analyses, and generating publication-quality graphics. An electronic notebook like Jupyter allows these analyses, along with documentation of procedures, to display locally or remotely in an internet browser, which can be saved as an HTML, PDF, or other file format for sharing with team members and the scientific community. The present report illustrates these methods using data from electrophysiological recordings of the musk shrew vagus—a model system to investigate gut-brain communication, for example, in cancer chemotherapy-induced emesis. We show methods for spike sorting (including statistical validation), spike train analysis, and analysis of compound action potentials in notebooks. Raw data and code are available from notebooks in data supplements or from an executable online version, which replicates all analyses without installing software—an implementation of reproducible research. This demonstrates the promise of combining disparate analyses into one platform, along with the ease of sharing this work. In an age of diverse, high-throughput computational workflows, this methodology can increase efficiency, transparency, and the collaborative potential of neurophysiological research.},

This focus on causation makes sense, because causal information can provide explanations of brain function and identify reliable targets with which~to understand cognitive function and prevent or change neurological conditions and psychiatric disorders. In this research, one of the most frequently used causal concepts is ‘mechanism’ — this is seen in the literature and language of the field, in grant and funding inquiries that specify what research is supported, and in journal guidelines on which contributions are considered for publication. In these contexts, mechanisms are commonly tied to expressions of the main aims of the field and cited as the ‘fundamental’, ‘foundational’ and/or ‘basic’ unit for understanding the brain. Despite its common usage and perceived importance, mechanism is used in different ways that are rarely distinguished. Given that this concept is defined in different ways throughout the field — and that there is often no clarification of which definition is intended — there remains a marked ambiguity about the fundamental goals, orientation and principles of the field. Here we provide an overview of causation and mechanism from the perspectives of neuroscience and philosophy of science, in order to address these challenges.},

Using the Morris water maze task we show that, in the rat, repeated nonreinforced expression of spatial memory causes extinction, which is unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis within the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus. However, if the number of nonreinforced retrieval trials is insufficient to induce long-lasting extinction, then a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process recovers the original memory. Inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis after reversal learning sessions impairs retention of the reversed preference and blocks persistence of the original one, suggesting that reversal learning involves reconsolidation rather than extinction of the original memory. Our results suggest the existence of a hippocampal protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation process that operates to recover or update retrieval-weakened memories from incomplete extinction.},

It is the only precursor for the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is vital for the processing of emotional regulation, hunger, sleep, and pain, as well as colonic motility and secretory activity in the gut. Tryptophan catabolites from the kynurenine degradation pathway also modulate neural activity and are active in the systemic inflammatory cascade. Additionally, tryptophan and its metabolites support the development of the central and enteric nervous systems. Accordingly, dysregulation of tryptophan metabolites plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Gut microbes influence tryptophan metabolism directly and indirectly, with corresponding changes in behavior and cognition. The gut microbiome has thus garnered much attention as a therapeutic target for both neurologic and psychiatric disorders where tryptophan and its metabolites play a prominent role. In this review, we will touch upon some of these features and their involvement in health and disease.},

The two approaches as commonly practiced can be unified with a certain model specification, now popular in the statistics literature, called spike-and-slab priors. A spike-and-slab prior is a mixture of a null model, the spike, with an effect model, the slab. The estimate of the effect size here is a function of the Bayes factor, showing that estimation and model comparison can be unified. The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not. Both approaches, either privileging the null or not, are useful depending on the goals of the analyst.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory decline and subsequent loss of broader cognitive functions. Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory, for which the hippocampus has a crucial role. However, it has been uncertain whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia in these mice is age-dependent, which correlates with a progressive reduction in spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating memory loss in the early stages of AD.},

  abstract = {Recent studies identified neuronal ensembles and circuits that hold specific memory information (memory engrams). Memory engrams are retained under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia. These engram cells can be activated by optogenetic stimulation for full-fledged recall, but not by stimulation using natural recall cues (thus, amnesia). We call this state of engrams “silent engrams” and the cells bearing them “silent engram cells.” The retention of memory information under amnesia suggests that the time-limited protein synthesis following learning is dispensable for memory storage, but may be necessary for effective memory retrieval processes. Here, we show that the full-fledged optogenetic recall persists at least 8 d after learning under protein synthesis inhibition-induced amnesia. This long-term retention of memory information correlates with equally persistent retention of functional engram cell-to-engram cell connectivity. Furthermore, inactivation of the connectivity of engram cell ensembles with its downstream counterparts, but not upstream ones, prevents optogenetic memory recall. Consistent with the previously reported lack of retention of augmented synaptic strength and reduced spine density in silent engram cells, optogenetic memory recall under amnesia is stimulation strength-dependent, with low-power stimulation eliciting only partial recall. Finally, the silent engram cells can be converted to active engram cells by overexpression of α-p-21–activated kinase 1, which increases spine density in engram cells. These results indicate that memory information is retained in a form of silent engram under protein synthesis inhibition-induced retrograde amnesia and support the hypothesis that memory is stored as the specific connectivity between engram cells.},

  abstract = {Insulin-resistant brain state is proposed to be the early sign of Alzheimer’s disease(AD), which can be studied in intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rodent model. ICV-STZ is reported to induce sporadic AD with the majority of the disease hallmarks as phenotype. On the other hand, Available experimental evidence has used varying doses of STZ ({$<$}1 to 3mg/kg) and studied its effect for different study durations, ranging from 14-270 days. Though these studies suggest 3mg/kg of ICV-STZ to be the optimum dose for progressive pathogenesis, the reason for such is elusive. Here we sought to investigate the mechanism of action of 3mg/kg ICV-STZ on cognitive and non-cognitive aspects at a follow-up interval of two weeks for two months. On 60th day, we examined layer thickness, cell density, ventricular volume, spine density, protein expression related to brain metabolism and mitochondrial function by histological examination. Findings suggest progressive loss of spatial, episodic, avoidance memory with increase in anxiety in a span of two month. Furthermore, hippocampal neurodegeneration, ventricular enlargement, diffused amyloid plaque deposition, loss of spine in dentate gyrus and imbalance in energy homeostasis was found on 60th day post injection. Interestingly, AD rats showed a uniform fraction of time spent in four quadrants of water maze with change in strategy when they were exposed to height. Our findings reveal that ICV-STZ injection at a dose of 3mg/kg can cause cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities due to structural loss both at neuronal as well as synaptic level, which is tightly associated with change in neuronal metabolism.},

We have therefore compared the behaviour and response to CNS injury of four inbred strains commonly used in molecular genetic studies to produce models of neurological disease. Adult, male 129/Ola, BALB/c, C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice (2-4 months) were initially subjected to behavioural tests that comprised a neurological examination, determination of motor function and cognitive testing in the Morris water maze. Also the response to CNS injury following an acute kainic acid (KA) challenge (30 mg kg-1, i.p.) was determined. The 129/Ola and BALB/c strains showed significant motor deficits when compared with the C57BL/6 and FVB/N strains. In contrast, only the FVB/N strain showed evidence of apparent cognitive impairments in the water maze as evidenced by increased pathlengths to locate the escape platforms and impaired performance in a probe trial. In addition, the FVB/N strain showed the most severe seizure response and mortality rate (62\%) following administration of KA (30 mg kg-1, i.p.). These behavioural changes were also associated with a greater degree of cell body and synaptophysin loss in the pyramidal CA3 hippocampal cell layer and astrogliosis 72-h post-dose. These data suggest that the FVB/N strain may not be the most suitable background strain for the development of new transgenic mice for the study of genes implicated in the learning and memory process.},

  abstract = {Successful behavior requires actively acquiring and representing information about the environment and people, and manipulating and using those acquired representations flexibly to optimally act in and on the world. The frontal lobes have figured prominently in most accounts of flexible or goal-directed behavior, as evidenced by often-reported behavioral inflexibility in individuals with frontal lobe dysfunction. Here, we propose that the hippocampus also plays a critical role by forming and reconstructing relational memory representations that underlie flexible cognition and social behavior. There is mounting evidence that damage to the hippocampus can produce inflexible and maladaptive behavior when such behavior places high demands on the generation, recombination, and flexible use of information. This is seen in abilities as diverse as memory, navigation, exploration, imagination, creativity, decision-making, character judgments, establishing and maintaining social bonds, empathy, social discourse, and language use. Thus, the hippocampus, together with its extensive interconnections with other neural systems, supports the flexible use of information in general. Further, we suggest that this understanding has important clinical implications. Hippocampal abnormalities can produce profound deficits in real-world situations, which typically place high demands on the flexible use of information, but are not always obvious on diagnostic tools tuned to frontal lobe function. This review documents the role of the hippocampus in supporting flexible representations and aims to expand our understanding of the dynamic networks that operate as we move through and create meaning of our world.},

It is also becoming apparent that glia cells are in reciprocal communication with neurons, orchestrate various neuromodulatory, homeostatic, metabolic, and immune mechanisms, and have a crucial role in neuroinflammatory mechanisms in MDD. Those cells mediate the central nervous system (CNS) response to systemic inflammation and psychological stress, but at the same time, they may be an origin of the inflammatory response in the CNS. The sources of activation of the inflammatory response in MDD are immense; however, in recent years, it is becoming increasingly evident that the gastrointestinal tract with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and increased intestinal permeability to bacterial LPS and food-derived antigens contribute to activation of low-grade inflammatory response with subsequent psychiatric manifestations. Furthermore, an excessive permeability to gut-derived antigenic material may lead to subsequent autoimmunities which are also known to be comorbid with MDD. In this review, we discuss fascinating interactions between the gastrointestinal tract, increased intestinal permeability, intestinal microbiota, and glia-neuron cross talk, and their roles in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory hypothesis of MDD. To emphasize those crucial intercommunications for the brain functions, we propose the term of microbiota-gut-immune-glia (MGIG) axis.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze is a commonly employed method to investigate learning and memory. The task demands experimental subjects use distal spatial cues in navigating to a hidden escape platform while swimming in a pool of opaque water. Since its primary description thirty years ago, several modifications have emerged. For example, part-way through the experiment, the target platform can be re-located, thus requiring subjects re-learn spatial aspects of the task. This procedure demands sequential memory encoding of highly similar events and can be selectively impaired by genetic and pharmacological methods affecting cognitive flexibility. While the primary reasons for employing re-locating platform tasks are to study aspects of cognitive flexibility, the paradigms also demonstrate a potential for reducing within-treatment group variation by enabling within-subject analysis. We tested this hypothesis using the C57BL/6 mouse line, a commonly chosen subject for behavioral experiments, and demonstrate that a within-subject comparison approach is both valid and effective in reducing variability. Interestingly, the within-subject statistical advantage is most pronounced for performance measures of short-term memory. In addition, we find that subject naivety, but not experimental inter-phase interval or subcutaneous saline injections, has a significant effect on variation in performance. We also found repeated training in the Morris water maze improved short-term memory without enhancing long-term memory. Together, the data suggest platform re-location tasks can help alleviate within-group variability, a major conundrum in behavioral neuroscience, and provide valuable insight into the general sources of variability underlying performance in cognitive tasks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Fos immunohistochemistry therefore provides a cellular method to label polysynaptically activated neurons and thereby map functional pathways.},

  abstract = {Stress represents a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recently, we dissected the destabilizing effects of acute stress on the excitatory glutamate system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we assessed the effects of single subanesthetic administration of ketamine (10~mg/kg) on glutamate transmission and dendritic arborization in the PFC of footshock (FS)-stressed rats, along with changes in depressive, anxious, and fear extinction behaviors. We found that ketamine, while inducing a mild increase of glutamate release in the PFC of naïve rats, blocked the acute stress-induced enhancement of glutamate release when administered 24 or 72~h before or 6~h after FS. Accordingly, the treatment with ketamine 6~h after FS also reduced the stress-dependent increase of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) amplitude in prelimbic (PL)-PFC. At the same time, ketamine injection 6~h after FS was found to rescue apical dendritic retraction of pyramidal neurons induced by acute stress in PL-PFC and facilitated contextual fear extinction. These results show rapid effects of ketamine in animals subjected to acute FS, in line with previous studies suggesting a therapeutic action of the drug in PTSD models. Our data are consistent with a mechanism of ketamine involving re-establishment of synaptic homeostasis, through restoration of glutamate release, and structural remodeling of dendrites.},

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for some of the responses to SSRIs, but it is not known whether mature dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) also contribute. We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were abolished. By contrast, mice lacking 5HT1ARs only in young adult-born GCs (abGCs) showed normal fluoxetine responses. Notably, 5HT1AR-deficient mice engineered to express functional 5HT1ARs only in DG GCs responded to fluoxetine, indicating that 5HT1ARs in DG GCs are sufficient to mediate an antidepressant response. Taken together, these data indicate that both mature DG GCs and young abGCs must be engaged for an antidepressant response.},

Evidence from preclinical models and clinical studies of depression have revealed an array of structural and functional maladaptive changes, whereby adverse environmental factors shape the brain. These changes, observed from the molecular and transcriptional levels through to large-scale brain networks, to the behaviours reveal a complex matrix of interrelated pathophysiological processes that differ between sexes, providing insight into the potential underpinnings of the sex bias of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although many preclinical studies use chronic stress protocols, long-term changes are also induced by acute exposure to traumatic stress, opening a path to identify determinants of resilient versus susceptible responses to both acute and chronic stress. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression has emerged as a key player underlying the persistent impact of stress on the brain. Indeed, histone modification, DNA methylation and microRNAs are closely involved in many aspects of the stress response and reveal the glutamate system as a key player. The success of ketamine has stimulated a whole line of research and development on drugs directly or indirectly targeting glutamate function. However, the challenge of translating the emerging understanding of stress pathophysiology into effective clinical treatments remains a major challenge.},

  abstract = {Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

We speculated that the increasing receptor concentrations may mediate this increasing sensitivity of the HPA axis to the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids. To examine this idea we treated rats with exogenous corticosterone from days 29 to 34, resulting in a down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptors in the brain at Day 35 to levels similar to those of younger animals. Subjects whose maturational increase in receptors was reversed in this manner were less sensitive to feedback inhibition of glucocorticoids. Specifically, compared to controls they continued to secrete corticosterone after the end of stress, and were relatively insensitive to the suppressive effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, on corticosterone titers. Our data specifically implicate the hippocampus in modulating feedback sensitivity, as down-regulation was extensive in this structure, and did not occur in the septum, amygdala, hypothalamus or pituitary.},

An open question is whether GCs have similar deleterious effects in the primate hippocampus. In fact, we showed that sustained and fatal stress was associated with preferential hippocampal damage in the vervet monkey; however, it was not possible to determine whether the excessive GC secretion that accompanied such stress was the damaging agent. The present study examines this possibility. Pellets of cortisol (the principal GC of primates) were stereotaxically implanted into hippocampi of 4 vervet monkeys; contralateral hippocampi were implanted with cholesterol pellets as a control. One year later at postmortem, preferential damage occurred in the cortisol-implanted side. In the cholesterol side, mild cell layer irregularity was noted in 2 of 4 cases. By contrast in the cortisol-exposed hippocampi, all cases had at least 2 of the following neuropathologic markers: cell layer irregularity, dendritic atrophy, soma shrinkage and condensation, or nuclear pyknosis. Damage was severe in some cases, and was restricted to the CA3/CA2 cellfield. This anatomical distribution of damage, and the cellular features of the damage agree with that observed in instances of GC-induced toxicity in the rodent hippocampus, and of stress-induced toxicity in the primate hippocampus. These observations suggest that sustained GC exposure (whether due to stress, Cushings syndrome or exogenous administration) might damage the human hippocampus.},

Explicit memory deficits have been demonstrated in Cushing syndrome, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder; an extensive literature suggests that hippocampal atrophy of the magnitude found in these disorders can give rise to such cognitive deficits.},

A stable mouse cell line was established that expresses the Cre protein under the control of the Cd2+-inducible metallothionein I gene promoter. DNA recombination was monitored with DNA substrates containing two directly repeated lox sites. One such substrate is a circular plasmid with two directly repeated lox sites (lox2) flanking a marker gene and was introduced into cells by Ca3(PO4)2 transformation. As a second substrate we used a pseudorabies virus (a herpesvirus) containing a lox2 insertion designed to provide a sensitive detection system for recombination. In both cases, site-specific recombination in vivo is dependent on the presence of the Cre protein and occurs specifically at the 34-base-pair lox sites. These results demonstrate the controlled site-specific synapsis of DNA and recombination by a prokaryotic protein in mammalian cells and suggest that Cre-mediated site-specific recombination may be a useful tool for understanding and modulating genome rearrangements in eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {\mkbibemph{Background/Aims:} Fluoxetine (Prozac) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor currently used to treat depression and mood disorders. It has been widely studied clinically and preclinically, yet there is limited knowledge of its pharmacokinetics in nonhuman primates. \mkbibemph{Methods:} The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine in rhesus macaques following both acute (1, 3, 5.6 and 10 mg/kg) and chronic doses (5.6 and 10 mg/kg/day) via different routes of administration (intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and oral). Blood samples were collected at multiple time points following administration and analyzed using mass spectrometry. \mkbibemph{Results:} Fluoxetine had a half-life of 11–16 h and norfluoxetine had a half-life of 21–29 h. Potentially functionally significant serum concentrations of norfluoxetine were present at 24 h even after a single administration of fluoxetine. Similar to observations in humans under steady state conditions, norfluoxetine accounted for the greater percentage of active drug in the blood stream. \mkbibemph{Conclusion:} A daily dose of 10 mg/kg administered orally maintained serum concentrations in the human clinical range over the course of 6 weeks. Given the long half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine observed in this study, precautions should be taken when designing preclinical studies to prevent accumulation of drug serum concentrations.},

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were singly housed for 8 weeks before hippocampi, prefrontal cortices and striata were collected for BDNF determination. Compared to rats housed two per cage, isolated rats showed a significant reduction on BDNF protein concentrations in the hippocampus while no changes were observed in the other brain regions examined. Moreover, housing condition had no effect on basal plasma corticosterone. On the basis of the proposed etiological participation of reduced central BDNF concentrations in affective disorders, our results would candidate social isolation as a model for the study of antidepressant treatments. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Factorial experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas are often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be "tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary `omnibus' F test" (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-test. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

  abstract = {Cognition-emotion interaction in the brain can be investigated by incorporating stimuli with emotional content into cognitive tasks. Emotional stimuli in the context of a working memory (WM) task yield increased activation in WM-related lateral prefrontal regions, whereas cognitive effort enhances deactivation in emotion-related cortical midline regions. N-methyl- d-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDA-Rs) are critically involved in WM, and NMDA-R antagonists, such as ketamine, accordingly affect WM but also have a profound impact on emotional processing, as underscored by the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms after administration of a single dose of ketamine. The effect of ketamine on both cognitive and emotional processing therefore makes it a useful tool to further explore cognition-emotion interaction in the brain. Twenty-three healthy subjects were administered ketamine to investigate whether its effects on WM performance and brain reactivity depend on emotional content or emotional valence of stimuli. Furthermore, we aimed at investigating how ketamine affects the integration of emotion and WM processes in emotion-related cortical midline regions and WM-related lateral prefrontal regions. Results show that ketamine modulates cognition-emotion interaction in the brain by inducing lateralized and valence-specific effects in emotion-related cortical midline regions, WM-related lateral prefrontal regions and insula. In emotion-related cortical midline regions ketamine abolishes enhancement of deactivation normally observed during cognitive effort, while in the right DLPFC and the left insula the previously described pattern of increased activation due to emotional content is abrogated exclusively for negative stimuli. Our data therefore shows a specific effect of ketamine on cognition-emotion interaction in the brain and indicates that its effect on amelioration of negative biases in MDD patients might be related to less interference of cognitive processing by negative emotional content.},

However, these tools provide little evidence regarding how the resolution of conflict unfolds over time. Here, we analyzed the trajectories of mouse movements while participants performed a continuous version of a spatial conflict task (the Simon task). We applied a novel combination of multiple regression analysis and distribution analysis to determine how conflict on the present trial and carry-over from the previous trial affect responding. Response on the previous trial and the degree of conflict on the previous and the current trial all influenced performance, but they did so differently: The previous response influenced the early part of the mouse trajectory, but the degree of previous and current conflict influenced later parts. This suggests that in this task experiencing conflict may not proactively ready the system to handle conflict on the next trial; rather, when conflict is experienced on the subsequent trial the previous compensatory processing may be re-activated more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

A key neurotransmitter involved in stress signaling is norepinephrine. Previous studies show that acute stress elevates norepinephrine levels in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a critical node regulating anxiety and upstream of stress responses. Here, we use mice expressing channelrhodopsin in norepinephrine neurons to selectively activate terminals in the BNST, and measure norepinephrine release with optogenetics-assisted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). We demonstrate that while corticosterone habituates to chronic restraint stress, cFos activation of medullary norepinephrine neurons shows equivalent activation under both acute and chronic stress conditions. Mice exposed to a single restraint session show an identical optically stimulated norepinephrine release profile compared to that of unexposed mice. Mice experiencing 5 days of restraint stress, however, show elevated norepinephrine release across multiple stimulation parameters, and reduced sensitivity to the α2-adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist idazoxan. These data are the first to examine norepinephrine release in the BNST to tonic and phasic stimulation frequencies, and confirm that repeated stress alters autoreceptor sensitivity.},

  abstract = {The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test is one of the most commonly used behavioral assays to evaluate anxiety-related behavior in rodents. It is an economic test (5\,min duration) without prior conditioning of the animals. The critical measure for anxiety is the time spent in the open arms of the maze. A confounding problem of the EPM is the so called one-trial tolerance (OTT), characterized by a marked decrease of open arm exploration in spite of treatment with anxiolytic acting benzodiazepines upon re-exposure to the EPM. This consistent finding is often raised as an evidence for the inappropriateness to re-test rodents in the EPM. However, a reliable re-test paradigm would broaden the usability and effectiveness of this test. Therefore, we tested how an extension of the inter-trial interval to 28\,days (instead of the usual 24\,h), and an additional change of the testing room would affect the open arm time and other behaviors on the EPM. In two experiments, drug-naive Wistar rats were exposed to the EPM on trial 1, and treated intraperitoneally with either vehicle or midazolam (0.25\,mg/kg) 30\,min before trial 2. Then, trial 2 (28\,days after trial 1) was carried out in either the same testing room (Experiment 1) or in another unfamiliar room (Experiment 2). Twenty-eight days after trial 1 the open arm time of the rats in the vehicle treated control rats of both experimental groups was comparable to that of the first trial, independent of the testing room. Most importantly, we found that the treatment with the benzodiazepine midazolam had a significantly anxiolytic-like (i.e., increase of open arm time) effect in trial 2 only when conducted in the previously unfamiliar testing room (Experiment 2). We suggest that in order to reliably re-test the EPM and to prevent confounding effects due to the OTT, an inter-trial interval of 28\,days and a change in testing rooms reinstates anxiolytic-like actions of benzodiazepines.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is one of several brain regions that together comprise the hippocampal formation. The hippocampal formation is a prominent C-shaped structure bulging in the floor of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The hippocampus proper consists of three major subfields (CA1-CA3). The other regions that together comprise the hippocampal formation consist of the dentate gyrus, the subicular complex, and the entorhinal cortex. Based on its extrinsic connectivity, the hippocampal formation receives a vast amount of highly processed multimodal sensory information that is funneled into the hippocampal formation mainly by the entorhinal cortex. The entorhinal cortex is connected to associational neocortical areas in a reciprocal manner. Extensive hippocampal integration of sensory information is established by a largely unidirectional chain of intrinsic hippocampal projections. Our current knowledge on hippocampal connectivity and function is largely based on studies of rodents and monkeys. It still remains to be determined to which extent such neuroanatomical data of experimental animals is applicable to the human hippocampal formation.},

  abstract = {Animal studies provided evidence that stress modulates multiple memory systems, favoring caudate nucleus-based “habit” memory over hippocampus-based “cognitive” memory. However, effects of stress on learning strategy and memory consolidation were not differentiated. We specifically address the effects of psychosocial stress on the applied learning strategy in humans. We designed a spatial learning task that allowed differentiating spatial from stimulus-response learning strategies during acquisition. In 13 subsequent trials, participants (88 male and female students) had to locate a “win” card out of four placed at a fixed location in a 3D model of a room. Relocating one cue in the last trial allowed inferring the applied learning strategy. Half of them participated first in the “Trier Social Stress Test.” Salivary cortisol and heart rate measurements were taken. Stressed participants used a stimulus-response strategy significantly more often than controls. Subsequent verbal report revealed that spatial learners had a more complete awareness of response options than stimulus-response learners. Importantly, learning performance was not affected by stress. Taken together, stress prior to learning facilitated simple stimulus-response learning strategies in humans—at the expense of a more cognitive learning strategy. Depending on the context, we consider this as an adaptive response.},

Further, he mentions the so called ROPE-only decision rule within his supplementary material, which is based on ROPE, but uses the full posterior information instead of the HDI. Of course, if it is about formalizing and guiding decisions then statistical decision theory is the framework to rely on, and this technical report elaborates the decision theoretic foundations of both decision rules. It appears that the foundation of the HDI+ROPE decision rule is rather artificial compared to the foundation of the ROPE-only decision rule, such that latter might be characterized as being closer to the underlying practical purpose than former.  Still, the ROPE-only decision rule employs a truly arbitrary, and thus debatable, choice of loss values.},

  abstract = {Most studies in the life sciences and other disciplines involve generating and analyzing numerical data of some type as the foundation for scientific findings. Working with numerical data involves multiple challenges. These include reproducible data acquisition, appropriate data storage, computationally correct data analysis, appropriate reporting and presentation of the results, and suitable data interpretation. Finding and correcting mistakes when analyzing and interpreting data can be frustrating and time-consuming. Presenting or publishing incorrect results is embarrassing but not uncommon. Particular sources of errors are inappropriate use of statistical methods and incorrect interpretation of data by software. To detect mistakes as early as possible, one should frequently check intermediate and final results for plausibility. Clearly documenting how quantities and results were obtained facilitates correcting mistakes. Properly understanding data is indispensable for reaching well-founded conclusions from experimental results. Units are needed to make sense of numbers, and uncertainty should be estimated to know how meaningful results are. Descriptive statistics and significance testing are useful tools for interpreting numerical results if applied correctly. However, blindly trusting in computed numbers can also be misleading, so it is worth thinking about how data should be summarized quantitatively to properly answer the question at hand. Finally, a suitable form of presentation is needed so that the data can properly support the interpretation and findings. By additionally sharing the relevant data, others can access, understand, and ultimately make use of the results. These quick tips are intended to provide guidelines for correctly interpreting, efficiently analyzing, and presenting numerical data in a useful way.},

  abstract = {Background-For decades, economists and sociologists have documented intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic disadvantage, demonstrating that economic, political, and social factors contribute to 'inherited hardship'. Drawing on biological factors, the 'Developmental Origins of Adult Health and Disease model posits that fetal exposure to maternal prenatal distress associated with socioeconomic disadvantage compromises offspring's neurodevelopment, affecting short and long-term physical and mental health, and thereby psychosocial standing and resources. Increasing evidence suggests that mother-to-child influence does occur prenatally, in part via maternal and offspring atypical HPA axis regulation, with negative effects on the maturation of prefrontal and subcortical neural circuits in the offspring. However, even this in utero timeframe may be insufficient to understand biological aspects of the transmission of factors contributing to disadvantage across generations. Methods-We review animal studies and emerging human research indicating that parents' childhood experiences may transfer epigenetic marks that could impact the development of their offspring independently of and in interaction with their offspring's perinatal and early childhood direct exposures to stress stemming from socioeconomic disadvantage and adversity. Results-Animal models point to epigenetic mechanisms by which traits that could contribute to disadvantage may be transmitted across generations. However epigenetic pathways of parental childhood experiences influencing child outcomes in the next generation is only beginning to be studied in humans. With a focus on translational research, we point to design features and methodological considerations for human cohort studies to be able to test the intergenerational transmission hypothesis, and we illustrate this with existing longitudinal studies. Conclusions-Epigenetic intergenerational transmission, if at play in human populations, could have policy implications in terms of reducing the continuation of disadvantage across generations. Further research is needed to address this gap in the understanding of the perpetuation of compromised lives across generations.},

  abstract = {The formation and retention of hippocampus-dependent memories is impacted by neurogenesis, a process that involves the production of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Recent studies demonstrate that increasing neurogenesis after memory formation induces forgetting of previously acquired memories. Neurogenesis-induced forgetting was originally demonstrated in mice, but a recent report suggests that the same effect may be absent in rats. Although a general species difference is possible, other potential explanations for these incongruent findings are that memories which are more strongly reinforced become resilient to forgetting or that perhaps only certain types of memories are affected. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis-induced forgetting occurs in rats using several hippocampus-dependent tasks including contextual fear conditioning (CFC), the Morris Water Task (MWT), and touchscreen paired associates learning (PAL). Neurogenesis was increased following training using voluntary exercise for 4~weeks before recall of the previous memory was assessed. We show that voluntary running causes forgetting of context fear memories in a neurogenesis-dependent manner, and that neurogenesis-induced forgetting is present in rats across behavioral tasks despite differences in complexity or reliance on spatial, context, or object memories. In addition, we asked whether stronger memories are less susceptible to forgetting by varying the strength of training. Even with a very strong training protocol in the CFC task, we still observed enhanced forgetting related to increased neurogenesis. These results suggest that forgetting due to neurogenesis is a conserved mechanism that aids in the clearance of memories.},

  abstract = {Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) specifically increase serotonin (5-HT) levels in the synaptic cleft and are widely used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. There are 14 established subtypes of 5-HT receptors in rodents, each of which has regionally different expression patterns. Many preclinical studies have suggested that the hippocampus, which contains abundant 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor subtypes in the dentate gyrus (DG), is critically involved in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. This review article will analyze studies demonstrating regulation of hippocampal functions and hippocampus-dependent behaviors by SSRIs and similar serotonergic agents. Multiple studies indicate that 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor signaling in the DG contributes to SSRI-mediated promotion of neurogenesis and increased neurotrophic factors expression. Chronic SSRI treatment causes functions and phenotypes of mature granule cells (GCs) to revert to immature-like phenotypes defined as a “dematured” state in the DG, and to increase monoamine reactivity at the dentate-to-CA3 synapses, via 5-HT4 receptor signaling. Behavioral studies demonstrate that the 5-HT1A receptors on mature GCs are critical for expression of antidepressant effects in the forced swim test and in novelty suppressed feeding; such studies also note that 5-HT4 receptors mediate neurogenesis-dependent antidepressant activity in, for example, novelty-suppressed feeding. Despite their limitations, the collective results of these studies describe a potential new mechanism of action, in which 5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor signaling, either independently or cooperatively, modulates the function of the hippocampal DG at multiple levels, any of which could play a critical role in the antidepressant actions of 5-HT-enhancing drugs.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in a number of disorders where reward processing is disrupted but whether new neurons regulate specific aspects of reward-related decision making remains unclear. Given the role of the hippocampus in future-oriented cognition, here we tested whether adult neurogenesis regulates preference for future, advantageous rewards in a delay discounting paradigm for rats. Indeed, blocking neurogenesis caused a profound aversion for delayed rewards, and biased choice behavior toward immediately available, but smaller, rewards. Consistent with a role for the ventral hippocampus in impulsive decision making and future-thinking, neurogenesis-deficient animals displayed reduced activity in the ventral hippocampus. In intact animals, delay-based decision making restructured dendrites and spines in adult-born neurons and specifically activated adult-born neurons in the ventral dentate gyrus, relative to dorsal activation in rats that chose between immediately-available rewards. Putative developmentally-born cells, located in the superficial granule cell layer, did not display task-specific activity. These findings identify a novel and specific role for neurogenesis in decisions about future rewards, thereby implicating newborn neurons in disorders where short-sighted gains are preferred at the expense of long-term health.},

It is a fast and relatively easy test that provides a variety of behavioral information ranging from general ambulatory ability to data regarding the emotionality of the subject animal. As it relates to rodent models, the procedure allows the study of different strains of mice or rats both laboratory bred and wild-captured. The technique also readily lends itself to the investigation of different pharmacological compounds for anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects. Here, a protocol for use of the open field maze to describe mouse behaviors is detailed and a simple analysis of general locomotor ability and anxiety-related emotional behaviors between two strains of C57BL/6 mice is performed. Briefly, using the described protocol we show Wild Type mice exhibited significantly less anxiety related behaviors than did age-matched Knock Out mice while both strains exhibited similar ambulatory ability.},

  abstract = {Episodic memories are multifaceted and malleable, capable of being transformed with time and experience at both the neural level and psychological level. At the neural level, episodic memories are transformed from being dependent on the hippocampus to becoming represented in neocortical structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and back again, while at the psychological level, detailed, perceptually rich memories, are transformed to ones retaining only the gist of an experience or a schema related to it. Trace Transformation Theory (TTT) initially proposed that neural and psychological transformations are linked and proceed in tandem. Building on recent studies on the neurobiology of memory transformation in rodents and on the organization of the hippocampus and its functional cortical connectivity in humans, we present an updated version of TTT that is more precise and detailed with respect to the dynamic processes and structures implicated in memory transformation. At the heart of the updated TTT lies the long axis of the hippocampus whose functional differentiation and connectivity to neocortex make it a hub for memory formation and transformation. The posterior hippocampus, connected to perceptual and spatial representational systems in posterior neocortex, supports fine, perceptually rich, local details of memories; the anterior hippocampus, connected to conceptual systems in anterior neocortex, supports coarse, global representations that constitute the gist of a memory. Notable among the anterior neocortical structures is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) which supports representation of schemas that code for common aspects of memories across different episodes. Linking the aHPC with mPFC is the entorhinal cortex (EC) which conveys information needed for the interaction/translation between gist and schemas. Thus, the long axis of the hippocampus, mPFC and EC provide the representational gradient, from fine to coarse and from perceptual to conceptual, that can implement processes implicated in memory transformation. Each of these representations of an episodic memory can co-exist and be in dynamic flux as they interact with one another throughout the memory's lifetime, going from detailed to schematic and possibly back again, all mediated by corresponding changes in neural representation.},

  abstract = {Chronic stress-induced depression is a common hallmark of many psychiatric disorders with high morbidity rate. Stress-induced dysregulation of noradrenergic system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. Lack of monoamine in the brain has been believed to be the main causative factor behind pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and several antidepressants functions by increasing the monoamine level at the synapses in the brain. However, it is undetermined whether the noradrenergic receptor stimulation is critical for the therapeutic effect of antidepressant. Contrary to noradrenergic receptor stimulation, it has been suggested that the desensitization of β-adrenoceptor is involved in the therapeutic effect of antidepressant. In addition, enhanced noradrenaline (NA) release is central response to stress and thought to be a risk factor for the development of MDD. Moreover, fast acting antidepressant suppresses the hyperactivation of noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus (LC). However, it is unclear how they alter the firing activity of LC neurons. These inconsistent reports about antidepressant effect of NA-reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) and enhanced release of NA as a stress response complicate our understanding about the pathophysiology of MDD. In this review, we will discuss the role of NA in pathophysiology of stress and the mechanism of therapeutic effect of NA in MDD. We will also discuss the possible contributions of each subtype of noradrenergic receptors on LC neurons, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and brain derived neurotrophic factor-induced hippocampal neurogenesis during stress and therapeutic effect of NRIs in MDD.},

However, a fundamental problem is that it remains unclear as to what extent AHN actually occurs in humans. The answer to this is indispensable when physiological and pathological functions of human AHN are deduced from studies of rodent AHN, but there are controversial data on the extent of human AHN. In this review, studies on AHN performed in rodents and humans will be briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the studies in non-human primates. Then, how data of rodent and non-human primate AHN should be applied for understanding human AHN will be discussed.},

  abstract = {I must ask the reader's indulgence for this article's concern with applications of the stress concept, which are distinct from, although related to clinical medicine. It has not been my object to deal with the way physicians have been aided by stress research in the practice of medicine--that information is already widely available. Rather, I have attempted to sketch briefly the history of the stress theory and to demonstrate how this information can help anyone, physician or layman, lead a more complete and satisfying life. The applications of the stress theory have been dealt with at length elsewhere. I believe that we can find within scientifically verified observations the basis of a code of behavior suited to our century. The great laws of nature that regulate the defenses of living beings against stress of any kind are essentially the same at all levels of life, from individual cells to entire complex human organisms and societies. It helps a great deal to understand the fundamental advantages and disadvantages of catatoxic and syntoxic attitudes by studying the biologic basis of self-preservation as reflected in syntoxic and catatoxic chemical mechanisms. When applied to everyday problems, this understanding should lead to choices most likely to provide us the pleasant eustress (from the Greek eu meaning good, as in euphoria) involved in achieving fulfillment and victory, thereby avoiding the self-destructive distress of frustration and failure. So the translation of the laws governing resistance of cells and organs to a code of behavior comes down to three basic precepts: 1. Find your own natural stress level. People differ with regard to the amount and kind of work they consider worth doing to meet the exigencies of daily life and to assure their future security and happiness. In this respect, all of us are influenced by hereditary predispositions and the expectations of our society. Only through planned self-analysis can we establish what we really want; too many people suffer all their lives because they are too conservative to risk a radical change by breaking with hiabits or traditions. 2. Altruistic egoism. The selfish (i.e., self-interested) hoarding of the goodwill, respect, esteem, support, and love of our neighbors is the most efficient way to give vent to our pent-up energy and to create a more enjoyable, beautiful, or useful environment.3. Earn thy neighbor's love. This motto--which is merely a rewording of the command to "love thy neighbor as thyself"--is compatible with man's natural structure, and although it is based on altruistic egoism, it could hardly be attacked as unethical. Who would blame the man who wants to assure his own homeostasis and happiness only by accumulating the treasure of other poeple's benevolence and love? Yet this makes him virtually unassailable, for nobody wants to attack and destroy those upon whom he depends.},

  abstract = {Handling is a well-known source of stress to laboratory animals and can affect variability of results and even compromise animal welfare. The conventional tail handling in mice has been shown to induce aversion and anxiety-like behaviour. Recent findings demonstrate that the use of alternative handling techniques, e.g. tunnel handling, can mitigate negative handling-induced effects. Here, we show that technique and frequency of handling influence affective behaviour and stress hormone release of subjects in a sex-dependent manner. While frequent tail handling led to a reduction of wellbeing-associated burrowing and increased despair-like behaviour in male mice, females seemed unaffected. Instead, they displayed a stress response to a low handling frequency, which was not detectable in males. This could suggest that in terms of refinement, the impact in handling could differ between the sexes. Independently from this observation, both sexes preferred to interact with the tunnel. Mice generally explored the tunnel more often than the tail-handling hands of the experimenter and showed more positively rated approaches, e.g. touching or climbing, and at the same time, less defensive burrowing, indicating a strong preference for the tunnel.},

Yet, relationships among trauma, stress-induced neural changes and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity have not been determined. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of life trauma on basal cortisol levels and neural responses to acute stress in 73 healthy individuals during brief stress and neutral-relaxing imagery using a well-established, individualized imagery method. We hypothesized that trauma experience would have a negative impact on brain function, resulting in altered basal cortisol levels via dysregulated neural control over the HPA axis system. Results showed that higher life trauma exposure was significantly associated with lower basal cortisol levels. Neuroimaging results indicated that both higher life trauma and low morning cortisol levels were associated with increased response to acute stress in limbic-medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions including the amygdala and hippocampus. A mediation analysis showed that increased limbic-MTL response to stress mediated the relationship between life trauma and low cortisol levels. Findings revealed a significant impact of lifetime trauma on neural responses to acute stress and HPA axis activity. Life trauma may sensitize limbic-MTL regions and its related peripheral systems, which could compromise stress regulation and HPA axis function, and increase risk for negative stress-related health outcomes.},

However, CUS exhibits translational inconsistencies, some of them resulting from the use of adult rodents, despite the evidence that vulnerability for many psychiatric disorders accumulates during early life. Here, we assessed the validity of the CUS model by including ethologically-relevant paradigms in juvenile rats. Thus, socially-isolated (SI) rats were submitted to CUS and compared with SI (experiment 1) and group-housed controls (experiment 1 and 2). We found that lower body-weight gain and hyperlocomotion, instead of sucrose consumption and preference, were the best parameters to monitor the progression of CUS, which also affected gene expression and neurotransmitter contents associated with that CUS-related phenotype. The behavioural characterisation after CUS placed locomotion and exploratory activity as the best stress predictors. By employing the exploratory factor analysis, we reduced each behavioural paradigm to few latent variables which clustered into two general domains that strongly predicted the CUS condition: (1) hyper-responsivity to novelty and mild threats, and (2) anxiety/depressive-like response. Altogether, the analyses of observable and latent variables indicate that early-life stress impairs the arousal-inhibition system leading to augmented and persistent responses towards novel, rewarding, and mildly-threatening stimuli, accompanied by lower body-weight gain.},

C57BL6 mice were investigated in a small animal MRI scanner following 2, 10, or 15 days of acquisition learning, or 5 days of reversal learning. Spatial learning coincided with progressive and changing FC between telencephalic regions that have been implemented in spatial learning (such as hippocampus, cingulate, visual, and motor cortex). Search strategy assessment demonstrated that the use of cognitively advanced spatial strategies correlated positively with extensive telencephalic connectivity, whereas non-spatial strategies correlated negatively with connectivity. FC patterns were different and more extensive after reversal learning compared with after extended acquisition learning, which could explain why reversal learning has been shown to be more sensitive to subtle functional defects.},

Subjects with a history of major depression had significantly smaller left and right hippocampal volumes with no differences in total cerebral volumes. The degree of hippocampal volume reduction correlated with total duration of major depression. In addition, large (diameter {$>$} or = 4.5 mm)-hippocampal low signal foci (LSF) were found within the hippocampus, and their number also correlated with the total number of days depressed. These results suggest that depression is associated with hippocampal atrophy, perhaps due to a progressive process mediated by glucocorticoid neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Both food-storing behaviour and the hippocampus change annually in food-storing birds. Food storing increases substantially in autumn and winter in chickadees and tits, jays and nutcrackers and nuthatches. The total size of the chickadee hippocampus increases in autumn and winter as does the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampus is necessary for accurate cache retrieval in food-storing birds and is much larger in food-storing birds than in non-storing passerines. It therefore seems probable that seasonal change in caching and seasonal change in the hippocampus are causally related. The peak in recruitment of new neurons into the hippocampus occurs before birds have completed food storing and cache retrieval for the year and may therefore be associated with spacing caches, encoding the spatial locations of caches, or creating a neuronal architecture involved in the recollection of cache sites. The factors controlling hippocampal plasticity in food-storing birds are not well understood. Photoperiodic manipulations that produce change in food-storing behaviour have no effect on either hippocampal size or neuronal recruitment. Available evidence suggests that changes in hippocampal size and neurogenesis may be a consequence of the behavioural and cognitive involvement of the hippocampus in storing and retrieving food.},

  abstract = {Animals receive environmental stimuli from neural signals in order to produce hormones that control immune responses. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a group of steroid hormones produced in the adrenal cortex and well-known mediators for the nervous and immune systems. GC secretion is induced by circadian rhythm and stress, and plasma GC levels are high at the active phase of animals and under stress condition. Clinically, GCs are used for allergies, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation, because they have strong anti-inflammatory effects and induce the apoptosis of lymphocytes. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) acts as a transcription factor and represses the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins by binding to its motif, glucocorticoid-response element, or to other transcription factors. In mice, GR suppresses the antigen-stimulated inflammation mediated by macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells, and impairs cytotoxic immune responses by downregulating interferon-γ production and inhibiting the development of type-1 helper T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells. These immune inhibitory effects prevent lethality by excessive inflammation, but at the same time increase the susceptibility to infection and cancer. GCs can also activate the immune system. The circadian cycle of GC secretion controls the diurnal oscillations of the distribution and response of T cells, thus supporting T cell maintenance and effective immune protection against infection. Moreover, several reports have shown that GR has the potential to enhance the activities of Th2, Th17, and immunoglobulin-producing B cells. Stress has two different effects on immune responses: immune suppression to cause mortality by infection and cancer, and excessive immune activation to induce chronic inflammation and autoimmune disease. Consistently, stress-induced GCs strongly suppress cell-mediated immunity and cause viral infection and tumor development. They may also enhance the development of pathogenic helper T cells and cause tissue damage through neural and intestinal inflammation. Past studies have reported the positive and negative effects of GCs on the immune system. These opposing properties of GCs may regulate the immune balance between the responsiveness to antigens and excessive inflammation in steady-state and stress conditions.},

  abstract = {Serotonin (i.e., 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) plays a key role in stress responses in vertebrates. In mammals and teleosts, tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, includes two paralogs: Tph 1 and Tph 2. The response of the Tphs to stress has been reported in mammals, but less is known about the responses of these enzymes to stress in fish. In the present study, we examined whether heat stress affects the mRNA expression of these Tphs in the brain of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). We also determined the concentration of 5-HT in the brain, the mRNA expression of heat shock protein 90 alpha (Hsp90α) in the liver, plasma cortisol concentration, and blood glucose concentration in medaka. Whole-body exposure to repeated heat stress significantly decreased the mRNA expression of Tph1 and Tph2 in male and female medaka, whereas single heat stress did not affect the expression of either of the mRNAs. The 5-HT concentration also decreased significantly after repeated heat stress sessions in both sexes, but did not decrease after a single heat stress session. After single and repeated heat stress sessions, Hsp90α mRNA expression increased in both sexes; however, increments in the concentrations of plasma cortisol and blood glucose occurred in male, but not in female, medaka. These results suggest that both types of Tphs are involved in reducing 5-HT in the brain and are reliable indicators of chronic stress response in both sexes. However, stress responses in plasma cortisol and blood glucose concentrations differ between male and female medaka.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to describe how repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the hierarchical linear model (HLM) are used to evaluate intervention effect and to compare these methods, especially in relation to their requirements regarding assumptions, number of repeated measures, completeness of repeated measures, and equal intervals between measurements. APPROACH: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) data sets (101 residents in 14 nursing homes, five times) were analyzed to explain differences between repeated-measures ANOVA and the HLM. RESULTS: More detailed information is available when HLM is used. For example, repeated-measures ANOVA showed that there is a statistically significant difference on overall mean ADAS scores between the married and nonmarried groups. The HLM analysis showed more detailed information; the ADAS score of the married group was higher by 6.4 than that of the nonmarried group on the adjusted average ADAS scores (during the whole data collection period). Repeated-measures ANOVA does not provide results on the within-subject changes with days. The HLM provides the specific conclusion that ADAS scores were increased by the one unit of "days" variable (0.017) when days were included. DISCUSSION: Hierarchical linear model is a powerful statistical method that can be applied to longitudinal research to evaluate an intervention at multiple levels. The major differences between the repeated-measures ANOVA and the HLM can be summarized as follows: The HLM (a) has less strict assumptions, (b) has more flexible data requirements (dealing with the missing data), and (c) stresses individual change over group differences. More stringent assumptions should be satisfied in repeated-measures ANOVA than in the HLM. The HLM may resolve important statistical issues that have existed in repeated-measures ANOVA. The HLM has more flexible data requirements in that it (a) can be utilized when the measurement data collection points are unequal and (b) may be used when researchers do not have data for all follow-up points, whereas the repeated-measures ANOVA requires a fixed time series design (equal interval, equal number of time points).},

  abstract = {Introduction Pharmacotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of major depression. At the initiation of antidepressant treatment, both improvement of symptoms in the short term and relapse prevention in the long term should be taken into account. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and the acceptability of continuation/maintenance treatments and the relative efficacy/acceptability of antidepressants. Objective We will conduct a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine the relative efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in the long-term treatment of major depression. Methods and analysis We will include double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing any of the following antidepressants, which we included in our previous NMA of the acute treatment for major depression, with placebo or with another active drug for long-term treatment of major depression: agomelatine, amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, clomipramine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, trazodone, venlafaxine, vilazodone and vortioxetine. Our primary outcomes will be sustained response and all-cause dropouts. We will include four types of designs that are used to investigate long-term treatment. We will conduct two main analyses. First, we will conduct a pairwise meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants versus placebo to investigate whether continuing antidepressants after achieving a positive response in the acute-phase treatment is beneficial and/or safe. Second, we will conduct an NMA to examine the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the drugs. We will use a novel approach that will combine the results of acute-phase treatment NMA with long-term treatment studies to include all related designs in the NMA. We will ensure the validity of combining different designs and our new approach by checking the distribution of important effect modifiers and consistency of network. Ethics and dissemination This study did not require ethical approval. We will disseminate our findings by publishing results in a peer-reviewed journal.

  abstract = {The discovery of the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine has 1) led to a paradigm shift in our perception of what is possible in treating severe depression; 2) spurred a wave of basic, translation, and clinical research; and 3) provided an unprecedented investigational tool to conduct longitudinal mechanistic studies that may capture behavioral changes as complex as clinical remission and relapse within hours and days of treatment. Unfortunately, these advances did not yet translate into clinical biomarkers or novel treatments, beyond ketamine. In contrast to slow-acting antidepressants, in which targeting monoaminergic receptors identified several efficacious drugs with comparable mechanisms, the focus on the receptor targets of ketamine has failed in several clinical trials over the past decade. Thus, it is becoming increasingly crucial that we concentrate our effort on the downstream molecular mechanisms of ketamine and their effects on the brain circuitry and networks. Honoring the legacy of our mentor, friend, and colleague Ron Duman, we provide a historical note on the discovery of ketamine and its putative mechanisms. We then detail the molecular and circuits effect of ketamine based on preclinical findings, followed by a summary of the impact of this work on our understanding of chronic stress pathology across psychiatric disorders, with particular emphasis on the role of synaptic connectivity and its brain network effects in the pathology and treatment of clinical depression.},

Recent studies indicate that these cells possess the morphology and physiological properties of more established neurons. However, the function of adult generated neurons is still a matter of debate. We previously demonstrated that certain forms of associative learning can enhance the survival of new neurons and a reduction in neurogenesis coincides with impaired learning of the hippocampal-dependent task of trace eyeblink conditioning. Using the toxin methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) for proliferating cells, we tested whether reduction of neurogenesis affected learning and performance associated with different hippocampal dependent tasks: spatial navigation learning in a Morris water maze, fear responses to context and an explicit cue after training with a trace fear paradigm. We also examined exploratory behavior in an elevated plus maze. Rats were injected with MAM (7 mg/kg) or saline for 14 days, concurrent with BrdU, to label new neurons on days 10, 12, and 14. After treatment, groups of rats were tested in the various tasks. A significant reduction in new neurons in the adult hippocampus was associated with impaired performance in some tasks, but not with others. Specifically, treatment with the antimitotic agent reduced the amount of fear acquired after exposure to a trace fear conditioning paradigm but did not affect contextual fear conditioning or spatial navigation learning in the Morris water maze. Nor did MAM treatment affect exploration in the elevated plus maze. These results combined with previous ones suggest that neurogenesis may be associated with the formation of some but not all types of hippocampal-dependent memories.},

  abstract = {Although multiple hypotheses had been proposed to clarify the causes of depression, the accurate pathogenesis and effective treatment of depression still need to be solved. Pathological change of astrocytes has been recognized to play a pivotal role in depression. Fluoxetine is the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, however, the underlying mechanisms of fluoxetine are incompletely excavated. Emerging evidence shows that fluoxetine promotes autophagic processes in tumor cells. However, whether astrocytic autophagy gets involved in the cytoprotection of fluoxetine on astrocytes in depression treatment remains unexplored. Here we prepared chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced mouse model and treated mice with fluoxetine (10\,mg/kg) for 4 weeks to determine the correlation between proautophagic effect of fluoxetine and astrocyte protection in depression. Primary hippocampal astrocytes were cultured to investigate the potential mechanism of fluoxetine in regulating astrocyte autophagy. We found that fluoxetine (10\,mg/kg) treatment promoted autophagosome formation and increased clearance of injured mitochondria, consequently protected astrocytes in CMS model mice. Fluoxetine (10\,μM) could also promote the autophagic flux unblocked via enhancing fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in primary astrocytes. Moreover, fluoxetine promoted mitophagy by increased colocalization of autophagosomes and mitochondria, eliminating damaged mitochondria in corticosterone-treated astrocytes. Further in vitro study showed that p53 presence is required for fluoxetine activated autophagy flux and fluoxetine promotes astrocytic autophagy in a p53-dependent mechanism. Collectively, this work gives us insights into a novel approach to treat depression depending on astrocytes, and provides a promising molecular target for the development of antidepressant drugs besides regulating neurotransmitters.},

  abstract = {Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, presents a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect in clinical and preclinical studies. Regarding ketamine effects on anxiety, there is a widespread discordance among pre-clinical studies. To address this issue, the present study reviewed the literature (electronic database MEDLINE) to summarize the profile of ketamine effects in animal tests of anxiety/fear. We found that ketamine anxiety/fear-related effects may depend on the anxiety paradigm, schedule of ketamine administration and tested species. Moreover, there was no report of ketamine effects in animal tests of fear related to panic disorder (PD). Based on that finding, we evaluated if treatment with ketamine and another NMDA antagonist, MK-801, would induce acute and sustained (24 hours later) anxiolytic and/or panicolytic-like effects in animals exposed to the elevated T-maze (ETM). The ETM evaluates, in the same animal, conflict-evoked and fear behaviors, which are related, respectively, to generalized anxiety disorder and PD. Male Wistar rats were systemically treated with racemic ketamine (10, 30 and 80 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and tested in the ETM in the same day or 24 hours after their administration. Ketamine did not affect the behavioral tasks performed in the ETM acutely or 24 h later. MK-801 impaired inhibitory avoidance in the ETM only at 45 min post-injection, suggesting a rapid but not sustained anxiolytic-like effect. Altogether our results suggest that ketamine might have mixed effects in anxiety tests while it does not affect panic-related behaviors.},

In mammals, the critical brain structure to receive and process olfactory information is the olfactory bulb, a structure characterized by a laminated pattern with different types of neurons, some of which project to distant telencephalic structures, like the piriform cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampal formation. Therefore, the olfactory bulb is the first structure of a complex cognitive network that relates olfaction to different types of memory, including episodic memories. The olfactory bulb continuously adds inhibitory newborn neurons throughout life; these cells locate both in the granule and glomerular layers and integrate into the olfactory circuits, inhibiting projection neurons. However, the roles of these cells modulating olfactory memories are unclear, particularly their role in fear memories. We consider that olfactory neurogenesis might modulate olfactory fear memories by a plastic process occurring in the olfactory bulb.},

  abstract = {Ketamine is used clinically as an anaesthetic and a fast-acting antidepressant, and recreationally for its dissociative properties, raising concerns of addiction as a possible side effect. Addictive drugs such as cocaine increase the levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This facilitates synaptic plasticity in the mesolimbic system, which causes behavioural adaptations and eventually drives the transition to compulsion1–4. The addiction liability of ketamine is a matter of much debate, in part because of its complex pharmacology that among several targets includes N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonism5,6. Here we show that ketamine does not induce the synaptic plasticity that is typically observed with addictive drugs in mice, despite eliciting robust dopamine transients in the nucleus accumbens. Ketamine nevertheless supported reinforcement through the disinhibition of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This effect was mediated by NMDAR antagonism in GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurons of the VTA, but was quickly terminated by type-2 dopamine receptors on dopamine neurons. The rapid off-kinetics of the dopamine transients along with the NMDAR antagonism precluded the induction of synaptic plasticity in the VTA and the nucleus accumbens, and did not elicit locomotor sensitization or uncontrolled self-administration. In summary, the dual action of ketamine leads to a unique constellation of dopamine-driven positive reinforcement, but low addiction liability.},

Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain. Although the gut microbiota remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and psychotropic medications, and should examine microorganism function.},

  abstract = {Depression has been widely accepted as a major psychiatric disease affecting nearly 350 million people worldwide. Research focus is now shifting from studying the extrinsic and social factors of depression to the underlying molecular causes. Microglial activity is shown to be associated with pathological conditions, such as psychological stress, pathological aging, and chronic infections. These are primary immune effector cells in the CNS and regulate the extensive dialogue between the nervous and the immune systems in response to different immunological, physiological, and psychological stressors. Studies have suggested that during stress and pathologies, microglia play a significant role in the disruption of neuroplasticity and have detrimental effects on neuroprotection causing neuroinflammation and exacerbation of depression. After a systematic search of literature databases, relevant articles on the microglial regulation of bidirectional neuroimmune pathways affecting neuroplasticity and leading to depression were reviewed. Although, several hypotheses have been proposed for the microglial role in the onset of depression, it is clear that all molecular pathways to depression are linked through microglia-associated neuroinflammation and hippocampal degeneration. Molecular factors such as an excess of glucocorticoids and changes in gene expression of neurotrophic factors, as well as neuro active substances secreted by gut microbiota have also been shown to affect microglial morphology and phenotype resulting in depression. This review aims to critically analyze the various molecular pathways associated with the microglial role in depression.},

The chapter discusses how to set up a mixed model and how to perform statistical inference with a mixed model. The most important concept for understanding how to estimate and how to interpret mixed models is the distinction between fixed and random effects. One important characteristic of mixed models is that they allow random effects for multiple, possibly independent, random effects grouping factors. Mixed models are a modern class of statistical models that extend regular regression models by including random-effects parameters to account for dependencies among related data points.},

  abstract = {The wide spectrum of disruptions that characterizes major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) highlights the difficulties researchers are posed with as they try to mimic these disorders in the laboratory. Nonetheless, numerous attempts have been made to create rodent models of mood disorders or at least models of the symptoms of MDD and BD. Present antidepressants are all descendants of the serendipitous findings in the 1950s that the monoamine oxidase inhibitor iproniazid and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine were effective antidepressants. Thus, the need for improved animal models to provide insights into the neuropathology underlying the disease is critical. Such information is in turn crucial for identifying new antidepressants and mood stabilisers. Currently, there is a shift away from traditional animal models to more focused research dealing with an endophenotype-style approach, genetic models, and incorporation of new findings from human neuroimaging and genetic studies. Such approaches are opening up more tractable avenues for understanding the neurobiological and genetic bases of these disorders. Further, suchmodels promise to yield better translational animalmodels and hence more fruitful therapeutic targets. This overview focuses on such animal models and tests and how they can be used to assess MDD and BD in rodents.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Despite substantial research efforts the aetiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains poorly understood, which is due in part to the heterogeneity of the disorder and the complexity of designing appropriate animal models. However, in the last few decades, a focus on the development of novel stress-based paradigms and a focus on using hedonic/anhedonic behaviour have led to renewed optimism in the use of animal models to assess aspects of MDD. Objectives: Therefore, in this review article, dedicated to Athina Markou, we summarise the use of stress-based animal models for studying MDD in rodents and how reward-related readouts can be used to validate/assess the model and/or treatment. Results: We reveal the use and limitations of chronic stress paradigms, which we split into non-social (i.e. chronic mild stress), social (i.e. chronic social defeat) and drug-withdrawal paradigms for studying MDD and detail numerous reward-related readouts that are employed in preclinical research. Finally, we finish with a section regarding important factors to consider when using animal models. Conclusions: One of the most consistent findings following chronic stress exposure in rodents is a disruption of the brain reward system, which can be easily assessed using sucrose, social interaction, food, drug of abuse or intracranial self-stimulation as a readout. Probing the underlying causes of such alterations is providing a greater understanding of the potential systems and processes that are disrupted in MDD.},

  abstract = {Shannon's information entropy measures of the uncertainty of an event's outcome. If learning about a system reflects a decrease in uncertainty, then a plausible intuition is that learning should be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the organism's actions and/or perceptual states. To address whether this intuition is valid, I examined an artificial organism -- a simple robot -- that learned to navigate in an arena and analyzed the entropy of the outcome variables action, state, and reward. Entropy did indeed decrease in the initial stages of learning, but two factors complicated the scenario: (1) the introduction of new options discovered during the learning process and (2) the shifting patterns of perceptual and environmental states resulting from changes to the robot's learned movement strategies. These factors lead to a subsequent increase in entropy as the agent learned. I end with a discussion of the utility of information-based characterizations of learning.},

  abstract = {Expression profiling has established a 'molecular map' of the hippocampal formation, organized over its transverse and long axes. This molecular map provides a possible substrate for regional vulnerability and can in part account for why ageing and a range of diseases target different hippocampal subregions.Electrophysiological, functional MRI and behavioural studies have suggested a 'functional map' of the hippocampal formation, organized over its transverse and long axes. This map can explain why ageing and a range of diseases manifest with phenotypic diversity, despite targeting the same brain structure.Perhaps surprisingly, hippocampal dysfunction can be characterized by either an abnormal hypometabolic or hypermetabolic state.Establishing differential patterns of hippocampal vulnerability could provide information on the underlying mechanisms. For example, the fact that the entorhinal cortex is vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease but is relatively spared in cognitive ageing suggests that these conditions are mediated by separate pathogenic mechanisms.Establishing abnormalities in metabolic state can also suggest mechanistic clues. For example, the hippocampal hypermetabolism that is observed in schizophrenia is proposed to be linked to elevations in synaptic glutamate.Results from MRI tools that have been developed to image the hippocampal circuit have given rise to a pathophysiological framework. Newer imaging tools and large-scale longitudinal studies are expected to address outstanding issues, including mapping how ageing and disease spread over time, and providing additional insights into pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have indicated that sex hormones such as prolactin, estradiol and testosterone may play a role in the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in rodents and non-human primates, but so far there has been no investigation of their impact on human hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we quantify the expression levels of the relevant receptors in human post-mortem hippocampal tissue and a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line. Secondly, we investigate how these hormones modulate hippocampal neurogenesis using a human in vitro cellular model. Human female HPCs were cultured with biologically relevant concentrations of either prolactin, estradiol or testosterone. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and high-throughput analyses were used to quantify markers determining cell fate after HPCs were either maintained in a proliferative state or allowed to differentiate in the presence of these hormones. In proliferating cells, estrogen and testosterone increased cell density but had no clear effect on markers of proliferation or cell death to account for this. In differentiating cells, a 3-day treatment of prolactin elicited a transient effect, whereby it increased the proportion of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive and Doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells, but this effect was not apparent after 7-days. At this timepoint we instead observe a decrease in proliferation. Overall, our study demonstrates relatively minor, and possibly short-term effects of sex hormones on hippocampal neurogenesis in human cells. Further work will be needed to understand if our results differ to previous animal research due to species-specific differences, or whether it relates to limitations of our in vitro model.},

  abstract = {Rationale N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine induce cognitive symptoms in man similar to those of schizophrenia and therefore might be useful as models of the disease in animals. However, it is unclear which NMDAR antagonist(s) offer the best means to produce cognitive deficits in attention and working memory and to what extent those deficits can be measured selectively in rats. Objectives The present study systematically compared the effects of eight different NMDAR antagonists-MK-801, phencyclidine, (S)-(+)-ketamine, memantine, SDZ-220,581, Ro 25-6981, CP 101-606 and NVP-AAM077-in rats using standard tests of visual attention, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRT), and working memory, the delayed matching to position task (DMTP). Results Drug-induced responses varied qualitatively and quantitatively in both a compound- and a task-dependent manner. Effects were generally confounded by concomitant motor and motivational disruption, although individual doses of phencyclidine for example appeared to impair selectively cognitive functions. Interestingly, GluN2B selective antagonists were unique in their effects; inducing potential performance benefit in the 5CSRT. Conclusions Overall, the opportunity to induce a selective cognitive deficit in attention (5CSRT) or working memory (DMTP) in the rat is limited by both the NMDAR antagonist and the dose range used. The importance of a preclinical focus on ketamine, which is used more frequently in clinical settings, is limited by the extent to which cognitive effects can be both detected and quantified using this exposure regimen within these two operant assays. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

However, recently, neuroscience has been criticised for the poor use of experimental design and statistical analysis. Many of the statistical issues confronting neuroscience are similar to other areas of biology; however, there are some that occur more regularly in neuroscience studies. This review attempts to provide a succinct overview of some of the major issues that arise commonly in the analyses of neuroscience data. These include: the non-normal distribution of the data; inequality of variance between groups; extensive correlation in data for repeated measurements across time or space; excessive multiple testing; inadequate statistical power due to small sample sizes; pseudo-replication; and an over-emphasis on binary conclusions about statistical significance as opposed to effect sizes. Statistical analysis should be viewed as just another neuroscience tool, which is critical to the final outcome of the study. Therefore, it needs to be done well and it is a good idea to be proactive and seek help early, preferably before the study even begins.},

  abstract = {Although the function of adult neurogenesis is still unclear, tools for directly studying the behavioral role of new hippocampal neurons now exist in rodents. Since similar studies are impossible to do in humans, it is important to assess whether the role of new neurons in rodents is likely to be similar to that in humans. One feature of adult neurogenesis that varies tremendously across species is the number of neurons that are generated, so a key question is whether there are enough neurons generated in humans to impact function. In this review we examine neuroanatomy and circuit function in the hippocampus to ask how many granule neurons are needed to impact hippocampal function and then discuss what is known about numbers of new neurons produced in adult rats and humans. We conclude that relatively small numbers of neurons could affect hippocampal circuits and that the magnitude of adult neurogenesis in adult rats and humans is probably larger than generally believed.},

Drawing upon published data, I review species’ neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born. With some conceptual recalibration we may therefore be able to reconcile seemingly disparate findings and continue to ask how adult neurogenesis, as studied in animals, is relevant for human health.},

  abstract = {There has been interest in the function of adult neurogenesis since its discovery, by Joseph Altman, nearly 60 years ago. While controversy curtailed follow up studies, in the 1990s a second wave of research validated many of Altman’s original claims and revealed that factors such as stress and environmental stimulation altered the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. However, only with the advent of tools for manipulating neurogenesis did it become possible to perform causal tests of the function of newborn neurons. Here, we identify approximately 100 studies in which adult neurogenesis was manipulated to study its function. A majority of these studies demonstrate functions for adult neurogenesis in classic hippocampal behaviors such as context learning and spatial memory, as well as emotional behaviors related to stress, anxiety and depression. However, a closer look reveals a number of other, arguably understudied, functions in decision making, temporal association memory, and addiction. In this special issue, we present 16 new studies and review articles that continue to address and clarify the function of adult neurogenesis in behaviors as diverse as memory formation and consolidation, pattern separation and discrimination behaviors, addiction, and attention. Reviews of stem cell dynamics and regenerative properties provide insights into the mechanisms by which neurogenesis may be controlled to offset age- and disease-related brain injury. Finally, translation-oriented reviews identify next steps for minimizing the gap between discoveries made in animals and applications for human health. The articles in this issue synthesize and extend what we have learned in the last half century of functional neurogenesis research and identify themes that will define its future.},

In this review, we will discuss how depressive-like behavior can be induced in rodents, and the relationship between these models and depression in humans. Specifically, we suggest similarities between triggers of depressive-like behavior in animal models and human conditions known to increase the risk of depression, for example exhaustion and bullying. Although we acknowledge the potential problems in comparing animal findings to human conditions, such comparisons are useful for understanding the complexity of depression, and we highlight the need to develop clinical diagnoses and animal models in parallel to overcome translational uncertainties.},

However, the relationship between central 5-HT system and adult neurogenesis has not fully been understood. Here, we report that lowering 5-HT level in adulthood is also able to enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We used tamoxifen (TM)-induced Cre in Pet1-CreERT2 mice to either deplete central serotonergic (5-HTergic) neurons or inactivate 5-HT synthesis in adulthood and explore the role of central 5-HT in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. A dramatic increase in hippocampal neurogenesis is present in these two central 5-HT-deficient mice and it is largely prevented by administration of agonist for 5-HTR2c receptor. In addition, the survival of new-born neurons in the hippocampus is enhanced. Furthermore, the adult 5-HT-deficient mice showed reduced depression-like behaviors but enhanced contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate that lowering central 5-HT function in adulthood can also enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis, thus revealing a new aspect of central 5-HT in regulating adult neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {New neurons continue to be generated in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; n\,=\,17 post-mortem samples from controls; n\,=\,12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was originally discovered in rodents. Subsequent studies identified the adult neural stem cells and found important links between adult neurogenesis and plasticity, behavior, and disease. However, whether new neurons are produced in the human dentate gyrus (DG) during healthy aging is still debated. We and others readily observe proliferating neural progenitors in the infant hippocampus near immature cells expressing doublecortin (DCX), but the number of such cells decreases in children and few, if any, are present in adults. Recent investigations using dual antigen retrieval find many cells stained by DCX antibodies in adult human DG. This has been interpreted as evidence for high rates of adult neurogenesis, even at older ages. However, most of these DCX-labeled cells have mature morphology. Furthermore, studies in the adult human DG have not found a germinal region containing dividing progenitor cells. In this Dual Perspectives article, we show that dual antigen retrieval is not required for the detection of DCX in multiple human brain regions of infants or adults. We review prior studies and present new data showing that DCX is not uniquely expressed by newly born neurons: DCX is present in adult amygdala, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex neurons despite being absent in the neighboring DG. Analysis of available RNA-sequencing datasets supports the view that DG neurogenesis is rare or absent in the adult human brain. To resolve the conflicting interpretations in humans, it is necessary to identify and visualize dividing neuronal precursors or develop new methods to evaluate the age of a neuron at the single-cell level.},

  abstract = {To the Editor We read with interest the article by Andorra et al that evaluated the dynamics of brain volume loss in multiple sclerosis and modeled these variables in mixed-effects regression models as functions of disease duration. The authors report various goodness-of-fit measures of their models, focusing on the coefficient of determination (R2), which ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. For a model such as ordinary least squares regression, which includes only fixed-effects components, the interpretation of the R2 is intuitive and represents the variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s). For mixed-effects regression models, there are several variance components, which include both fixed and random effects. Andorra et al cite methods developed by Nakagawa and Schielzeth in calculating their article’s R2 values. The methods of Nakagawa and Schielzeth define R2 statistics for mixed-effects models as follows: (1) marginal R2 (variance explained by only fixed effects) and (2) conditional R2 (variance explained by both fixed and random effects). The marginal R2 is consistent with how most readers will interpret an R2 statistic (using the traditional ordinary least squares interpretation). Notably, Nakagawa and Schielzeth recommend that both marginal and conditional R2 be reported given that they convey unique and distinctive information.},

  abstract = {What brain regions are involved in regulating behavior when the emotional consequence of a stimulus changes from harmful to harmless? One way to address this question is to study the neural mechanisms underlying extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning, an important form of emotional regulation that has direct relevance to the treatment of human fear and anxiety disorders. In fear extinction, the capacity of a conditioned stimulus to elicit fear is gradually reduced by repeatedly presenting it in the absence of any aversive consequence. In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in research on the brain mechanisms of fear extinction. One region that has received considerable attention as a component of the brain’s extinction circuitry is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In the present article, we review the historical foundations of the modern notion that the mPFC plays a critical role in emotional regulation, a literature that was largely responsible for studies that explored the role of the mPFC in fear extinction. We also consider the role of the mPFC in a broader neural circuit for extinction that includes the amygdala and hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Virtually all antidepressant agents increase the birth of granule neurons in the adult dentate gyrus in rodents, providing a key basis for the neurogenesis hypothesis of antidepressant action. The novel antidepressant ketamine, however, shows antidepressant activity in humans within hours, far too rapid for a mechanism involving neuronal birth. Ketamine could potentially act more rapidly by enhancing maturation of new neurons born weeks earlier. To test this possibility, we assessed the effects of S-ketamine (S-()-ketamine hydrochloride) injection on maturation, as well as birth and survival, of new dentate gyrus granule neurons in rats, using the immediate-early gene zif268, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and BrdU, respectively. We show that S-ketamine has rapid effects on new neurons, increasing the proportion of functionally mature young granule neurons within 2 h. A single injection of S-ketamine also increased cell proliferation and functional maturation, and decreased depressive-like behavior, for at least 4 weeks in rats treated with long-term corticosterone administration (a depression model) and controls. However, the behavioral effects of S-ketamine on neophagia were unaffected by elimination of adult neurogenesis. Together, these results indicate that ketamine has surprisingly rapid and long-lasting effects on the recruitment of young neurons into hippocampal networks, but that ketamine has antidepressant-like effects that are independent of adult neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {The balance in actions mediated by mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors in certain regions of the brain, predominantly in the limbic system, appears critical for neuronal activity, stress responsiveness, and behavioral programming and adaptation. Alterations in the MR/GR balance appear to make nervous tissue vulnerable to damage; such damage can have adverse effects on the regulation of the stress response and may increase the risk for psychopathology. Besides the hippocampal formation, other subpopulations of neurons in extra-hippocampal brain areas have been also shown recently to be sensitive to changes in the corticosteroid milieu. From a critical analysis of the available data, the picture that emerges is that the balance (or imbalance) between MR/GR activation influences not only cell birth and death, but also other forms of neuroplasticity. MR occupation appears to promote pro-survival actions, while exclusive GR activation favors neurodegeneration. Interestingly, the sustained co-activation of both receptors, for example in chronic stress conditions, usually results in less drastic effects, restricted to dendritic atrophy and impaired synaptic plasticity. As our knowledge of the plastic changes underpinning the wide spectrum of behavior effects triggered by corticosteroids/stress growths, researchers should be able to better define new targets for therapeutic intervention in stress-related disorders. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {LEARNING OBJECTIVE: After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:• Analyze the effects of ketamine and esketamine on individuals with treatment-resistant depression. INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is commonly present in individuals with treatment-resistant depression, especially in attention, memory, and executive functions. These deficits are related to symptom severity, remission rates, and functional impairments during and after the acute phase of the disorder. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist previously used as an anesthetic, brings promising antidepressant results. This study systematically reviews the neurocognitive effects of ketamine and esketamine in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted at Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO using the terms depression, ketamine, and cognition. Title, abstract, and full-text reading were conducted independently by two of the authors (BSM and CSL). Risk of bias, study design, neuropsychological outcomes, and neuroimaging data were recorded. RESULTS: From a total of 997 hits, 14 articles were included. One study reported cognitive impairment after ketamine treatment for processing speed and verbal memory. Five studies reported improvements in processing speed, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, or cognitive flexibility. The esketamine study suggested no changes to performance. Lower attention, slower processing speed, and higher working memory are reported as predictors of antidepressant response. Brain areas for emotional and reward processing, including the amygdala, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex, show a normalizing tendency after ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine and esketamine do not seem to exert significant deleterious neurocognitive effects in the short or long term in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Results suggest neuropsychological functions and brain areas commonly impaired in treatment-resistant depression may especially benefit from subanesthetic ketamine infusions. Key questions that remain unanswered are discussed.},

  abstract = {The dentate gyrus is a neurogenic zone where neurons continue to be born throughout life, mature and integrate into the local circuitry. In adults, this generation of new neurons is thought to contribute to learning and memory formation. As newborn neurons mature, they undergo a developmental sequence in which different stages of development are marked by expression of different proteins. Doublecortin (DCX) is an early marker that is expressed in immature granule cells that are beginning migration and dendritic growth but is turned off before neurons reach maturity. In the present study, we use a mouse strain in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed under the control of the DCX promoter. We show that these neurons have high input resistances and some cells can discharge trains of action potentials. In mature granule cells, action potentials are followed by a slow afterhyperpolarization that is absent in EGFP-positive neurons. EGFP-positive neurons had a lower spine density than mature neurons and stimulation of either the medial or lateral perforant pathway activated dual component glutamatergic synapses that had both AMPA and NMDA receptors. NMDA receptors present at these synapses had slow kinetics and were blocked by ifenprodil, indicative of high GluN2B subunit content. These results show that EGFP-positive neurons in the DCX-EGFP mice are functionally immature both in their firing properties and excitatory synapses.},

A central thesis is that work with rats, monkeys, and humans (which has sometimes seemed to proceed independently in 3 separate literatures) is now largely in agreement about the function of the hippocampus and related structures. A biological perspective is presented that proposes multiple memory systems with different functions and distinct anatomical organizations. The hippocampus (together with anatomically related structures) is essential for a specific kind of memory, here termed declarative memory (similar terms include explicit and relational). Declarative memory is contrasted with a heterogeneous collection of nondeclarative (implicit) memory abilities that do not require the hippocampus (skills and habits, simple conditioning, and the phenomenon of priming). The hippocampus is needed temporarily to bind together distributed sites in neocortex that together represent a whole memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Traditionally LTP, that increases synaptic weights, has been ascribed a prominent role in learning and memory whereas LTD, that decreases them, has often been relegated to the category of “counterpart to LTP” that serves to prevent saturation of synapses. In contradiction of these assumptions, studies over the last several years have provided functional evidence for distinct roles of LTD in specific aspects of hippocampus-dependent associative learning and information encoding. Furthermore, evidence of the experience-dependent “pruning” of excitatory synapses, the majority of which are located on dendritic spines, by means of LTD has been provided. In addition, reports exist of the temporal and physical restriction of LTP in dendritic compartments by means of LTD. Here, we discuss the role of LTD and LTP in experience-dependent information encoding based on empirical evidence derived from conjoint behavioral and electrophysiological studies conducted in behaving rodents. We pinpoint the close interrelation between structural modifications of dendritic spines and the occurrence of LTP and LTD. We report on findings that support that whereas LTP serves to acquire the general scheme of a spatial representation, LTD enables retention of content details. We argue that LTD contributes to learning by engaging in a functional interplay with LTP, rather than serving as its simple counterpart, or negator. We propose that similar spatial experiences that share elements of neuronal representations can be modified by means of LTD to enable pattern separation. Therewith, LTD plays a crucial role in the disambiguation of similar spatial representations and the prevention of generalization.},

We explore the features of twelve popular R packages to identify the parts of analysis that can be effectively automated with the current tools and to point out new directions for further autoEDA development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing literature on the importance of hippocampal volume in geriatric depression. METHODS: We examined hippocampal volume in a group of elderly depressed patients and a group of elderly control subjects (N = 66 geriatric depressed patients and 18 elderly nondepressed control subjects) recruited through Duke's Mental Health Clinical Research Center for the Study of Depression in the Elderly. The subjects received a standardized evaluation, including a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain. Patients had unipolar major depression and were free of comorbid major psychiatric illness and neurologic illness. Differences were assessed using t tests and linear regression modeling. RESULTS: Accounting for the effects of age, gender, and total brain volume, depressed patients tended to have smaller right hippocampal volume (p =.014) and left hippocampal volume (p =.073). Among depressed patients, age of onset was negatively but not significantly related to right hippocampal volume (p =.052) and to left hippocampal volume (p =.062). We noted that among subjects with either right or left hippocampal volume of 3 mL or less, the vast majority were patients rather than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role for hippocampal dysfunction in depression, particularly in late-age onset depression. Longitudinal studies examining both depressive and cognitive outcomes are needed to clarify the relationships between the hippocampus, depression, and dementia.},

The relative size of spatial representation by place cells in the rat hippocampus gradually increases from dorsal to ventral.By contrast, rodent gene expression studies demonstrate multiple long-axis functional domains with sharply demarcated borders: at least nine in CA3 and three in CA1 and the dentate gyrus.Hippocampal intrinsic anatomical connectivity, as well as electrophysiological measures of coherence, show abrupt division from the ventral (anterior) one-third to dorsal (posterior) two-thirds of the hippocampus.Hippocampal involvement in unconditioned fear responses is limited to the ventral one-third.When these levels of organization are superimposed, a new model of hippocampal long-axis organization emerges: gradients with discrete domains, the latter dividing the hippocampus into (at least) three portions along the long axis.This model supersedes a simple dissociation of the dorsal from the ventral hippocampus and provides a potential framework for accommodating the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus in rodents and primates.},

We believe that the modifications to the stress paradigm in mice proposed herein allow some of these limitations to be overcome. Here, we discuss a variant of the standard stress paradigm, which results in anhedonia. This anhedonic state was defined by a decrease in sucrose preference that was not exhibited by all animals. As such, we propose the use of non-anhedonic, stressed mice as an internal control in experimental mouse models of depression. The application of an internal control for the effects of stress, along with optimized behavioural testing, can enable the analysis of biological correlates of stress-induced anhedonia versus the consequences of stress alone in a chronic-stress depression model. This is illustrated, for instance, by distinct physiological and molecular profiles in anhedonic and non-anhedonic groups subjected to stress. These results argue for the use of a subgroup of individuals who are negative for the induction of a depressive phenotype during experimental paradigms of depression as an internal control, for more refined modeling of this disorder in animals. © 2011 Strekalova et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {The sucrose preference test is used in laboratory rodents as a reward-based test to indicate a decrease in the sensitivity to a reward (anhedonia), which is a key symptom of major depression. It is based on the animal’s natural preference for sweets, with the assumption that this preference is in proportion to the pleasure that the animal experiences when it consumes sweetened solutions. As such, a reduction in the intake and preference of a sucrose-sweetened solution in rodents, typically compared to plain water over a fixed time frame, is considered as a manifestation of anhedonia. Despite the seemingly technical simplicity of the test, many laboratories experience serious difficulties in establishing this method in a sufficiently reproducible manner, especially in mice. Moreover, while a manifestation of anhedonia in the sucrose test parallels other depressive-like changes in rodents, the stratification of animals upon their hedonic responses as anhedonic and non-anhedonic is often problematic. Here, we address the most common technical, physical, and physiological phenomena that typically confound the evaluation of hedonic sensitivity with the sucrose test in laboratory mice and rats. The impact of these factors is often underestimated or neglected in routine laboratory work. When taken under control, however, the accuracy and sensitivity of the test is substantially increased and the abovementioned limitations with this method are resolved.},

  abstract = {The subjective measures used to study mood disorders in humans cannot be replicated in animals; however, the increasing application of objective neuropsychological methods provides opportunities to develop translational animal tasks. Here we describe a novel behavioral approach, which has enabled us to investigate similar affective biases in rodents. In our affective bias test (ABT), rats encounter two independent positive experiences-the association between food reward and specific digging substrate-during discrimination learning sessions. These are performed on separate days under either neutral conditions or during a pharmacological or affective state manipulation. Affective bias is then quantified using a preference test where both previously rewarded substrates are presented together and the rat's choices recorded. The absolute value of the experience is kept consistent and all other factors are counterbalanced so that any bias at recall can be attributed to treatment. Replicating previous findings from studies in healthy volunteers, we observe significant positive affective biases following acute treatment with typical (fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine) and atypical antidepressants (agomelatine, mirtazapine), and significant negative affective biases following treatment with drugs associated with inducing negative affective states in humans (FG7142, rimonabant, 13-cis retinoic acid). We also observed that acute psychosocial stress and environmental enrichment induce significant negative and positive affective biases, respectively, and provide evidence that these affective biases involve memory consolidation. The positive and negative affective biases induced in our test also mirror the antidepressant and pro-depressant effects of these drugs in patients suggesting our test has both translational and predictive validity. Our results suggest that cognitive affective biases could contribute to drug-or stress-induced mood changes in people and support the hypothesis that a cognitive neuropsychological mechanism contributes to antidepressant drug efficacy. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

This study used a novel rodent assay to investigate how different antidepressant drugs act to modify affective biases that have been implicated in depression. In this bowl-digging task, rats encounter two equal value learning experiences on separate days (one during an affective manipulation and the other during control conditions). This induces an affective bias that is quantified using a preference test in which both digging substrates are presented together and the individual rats' choices recorded. The assay can be used to measure affective biases associated with learning (when the treatment is given at the time of the experience) or examine the modification of previously acquired biases (when the treatment is administered before the preference test). The rapid-onset antidepressant ketamine, but not the delayed-onset antidepressant, venlafaxine, attenuated the previously acquired FG7142-induced negative bias following systemic administration. Venlafaxine but not ketamine induced a positive bias when administered before learning. We then used local drug infusions and excitotoxic lesions to localize the effects of ketamine to the medial prefrontal cortex and venlafaxine to the amygdala. Using a modified protocol we also showed that positive and negative biases amplified further when the numbers of substrate-reinforcer associations are increased. We propose that this pattern of results could explain the delayed onset of action of venlafaxine and the rapid onset of action but lack of long-term efficacy seen with ketamine.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Predicting the risk of drug-induced adverse psychiatric effects is important but currently not possible in non-human species. We investigated whether the affective bias test (ABT) could provide a preclinical method with translational and predictive validity. Experimental Approach: The ABT is a bowl-digging task, which quantifies biases associated with learning and memory. Rats encounter independent learning experiences, on separate days, under either acute manipulations (e.g. pro-depressant vs. control) or different absolute reward values (e.g. high vs. low). A bias is observed during a preference test when an animal's choices reflect their prior experience. We investigated the effects of putative pro-depressant drug treatments following acute or chronic administration on the formation of an affective bias or reward-induced positive bias respectively. Key Results: The immunomodulators LPS (10~μg·kg−1), corticosterone (10 and 30~mg·kg−1) and IFN-α (100~U·kg−1) induced a negative affective bias following acute treatment. Tetrabenazine (1~mg·kg−1) also induced a negative bias, but no effects were observed with varenicline, carbamazepine or montelukast. Chronic treatment with IFN-α (100~U·kg−1) and retinoic acid (10~mg·kg−1) impaired the formation of a reward-induced positive bias but did not alter sucrose preference test (SPT). Conclusions and Implications: The ABT has the potential to provide a novel approach to predict pro-depressant risk in a non-human species. Negative biases induced by acute treatment in the standard version of the task may also predict longer-term effects on reward processing as shown by the deficit in reward-induced positive bias following chronic treatment, an effect distinct from anhedonia in the SPT.

Similar effects are observed in rodent models, where anxiety is often measured in classic conflict tests such as the open-field test. Spontaneous rearing behavior, in which rodents stand on their hind legs to explore, can also be observed in this test yet is often ignored. We define two forms of rearing, supported rearing (in which the animal rears against the walls of the arena) and unsupported rearing (in which the animal rears without contacting the walls of the arena). Using an automated open-field test, we show that both rearing behaviors appear to be strongly context dependent and show clear sex differences, with females rearing less than males. We show that unsupported rearing is sensitive to acute stress, and is reduced under more averse testing conditions. Repeated testing and handling procedures lead to changes in several parameters over varying test sessions, yet unsupported rearing appears to be rather stable within a given animal. Rearing behaviors could therefore provide an additional measure of anxiety in rodents relevant for behavioral studies, as they appear to be highly sensitive to context and may be used in repeated testing designs.},

  abstract = {To study brain function, preclinical research heavily relies on animal monitoring and the subsequent analyses of behavior. Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by automating animal tracking, yet they poorly recognize ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to be employed in variable testing environments. Critical advances based on deep-learning and machine vision over the last couple of years now enable markerless tracking of individual body parts of freely moving rodents with high precision. Here, we compare the performance of commercially available platforms (EthoVision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi-Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. We provide a set of videos—carefully annotated by several human raters—of three widely used behavioral tests (open field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we then deployed the pose estimation software DeepLabCut to extract skeletal mouse representations. Using simple post-analyses, we were able to track animals based on their skeletal representation in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or greater accuracy than commercial behavioral tracking systems. We then developed supervised machine~learning classifiers that integrate the skeletal representation with the manual annotations. This new combined approach allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, while outperforming commercial solutions. Finally, we show that the resulting machine~learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, while outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.},

  abstract = {Episodic memory is defined as the ability to recall events in a spatiotemporal context. Formation of such memories is critically dependent on the hippocampal formation and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To be able to support the formation of episodic memories, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation should contain a neuronal code that follows several requirements. First, the code should include information about position of the agent ("where"), sequence of events ("when"), and the content of the experience itself ("what"). Second, the code should arise instantly thereby being able to support memory formation of one-shot experiences. For successful encoding and to avoid interference between memories during recall, variations in location, time, or in content of experience should result in unique ensemble activity. Finally, the code should capture several different resolutions of experience so that the necessary details relevant for future memory-based predictions will be stored. We review how neuronal codes in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus follow these requirements and argue that during formation of episodic memories entorhinal cortex provides hippocampus with instant information about ongoing experience. Such information originates from (a) spatially modulated neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, including grid cells, which provide a stable and universal positional metric of the environment; (b) a continuously varying signal in lateral entorhinal cortex providing a code for the temporal progression of events; and (c) entorhinal neurons coding the content of experiences exemplified by object-coding and odor-selective neurons. During formation of episodic memories, information from these systems are thought to be encoded as unique sequential ensemble activity in hippocampus, thereby encoding associations between the content of an event and its spatial and temporal contexts. Upon exposure to parts of the encoded stimuli, activity in these ensembles can be reinstated, leading to reactivation of the encoded activity pattern and memory recollection.},

These mechanisms are mediated by AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking in postsynaptic neurons. However, the regulatory mechanism of bidirectional plasticity at excitatory synapses remains unclear. We present a network model of AMPAR trafficking for adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which reproduces both LTP and LTD. We show that the induction of both LTP and LTD is regulated by the competition between exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPARs, which are mediated by the calcium-sensors synaptotagmin 1/7 (Syt1/7) and protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1), respectively. Our result indicates that recycling endosomes containing AMPAR are always ready for Syt1/7-dependent exocytosis of AMPAR at peri-synaptic/synaptic membranes. This is because molecular motor myosin V               b               constitutively transports the recycling endosome toward the membrane in a Ca               2+               -independent manner.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder negatively impacts the sensitivity and adaptability of the brain's predictive coding framework. The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short-term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity (rMMN). The rMMN paradigm was run 3–4 h after a single 0.44 mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7 ng/mL) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges. Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 70\% of patients demonstrated at least a 50\% reduction their MADRS global score. Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials, directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine's acute attenuation of the MMN. This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post-deviant tone were used. Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex, which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24 h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depression. However, the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that, at least within the short term, ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration.},

Here, we studied whether adolescent administration of fluoxetine can prevent memory deficits in AD transgenic mice that harbour PS1m146v, APPswe and TauP301L mutations (3~×~TgAD). FLX was applied through peritoneal injection to the mice at postnatal day 35 (p35) for 15 consecutive days, and the effects of FLX were observed at 6-month. We found that adolescent administration of FLX improved learning and memory abilities in 6-month-old 3~×~TgAD mice. FLX exposure also increased the sizes of the hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and extensive cortex regions, with increased numbers of neurons and higher dendritic spine density. Meanwhile, the synaptic plasticity of neurons in the hippocampus was remodelled, and the expression levels of synaptic-related proteins were increased along with activation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling pathway. Finally, we found that FLX effectively prevented the increase of beta-amyloid (Aβ) levels. These data suggest that adolescent administration of the antidepressant drug FLX can efficiently preserve cognitive functions and improve pathologies in 3×Tg AD mice.},

  abstract = {Rationale: The high fat and sucrose diet, known as the obesogenic diet (OD), has been related to low-grade chronic inflammation and neurodevelopmental disorders.  Emerging evidence suggests that OD influences cognitive and social function via  the gut-brain axis. However, the effects of OD during adolescence on future  health have been unclear. Meanwhile, the underlying mechanisms and effective  interventions are not fully understood. Polysaccharides, one of the most abundant  substances in the Eucommiae cortex, exhibit potential immunomodulatory and  neuroprotective effects. Here, we aimed to investigate the impact of OD on  adolescents, explore the modulating roles of Eucommiae cortex polysaccharides  (EPs) on OD-induced behavioral dysfunction, and elucidate the underlying  molecular mechanisms. Methods: In the present study, four-week-old mice were fed  with OD for four weeks to simulate persistent OD in adolescents. The behavioral  features were accessed by open field test and Morris water maze. The gut  bacterial structure was identified by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The gene  and protein expression in colonic tissues and hippocampus were detected by  qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and  immunofluorescence staining. Detection of biological metabolites in serum and  hippocampal tissues was performed by widely targeted metabolomics and targeted  metabolomics. Results: We found that OD-fed mice showed cognitive and  social-behavioral deficits accompanied by gut dysbiosis and systematic tryptophan  (Trp) metabolism disorders, which increased kynurenine (Kyn) concentration in the  hippocampus. Bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) induced  microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, directing the metabolism of Kyn in the  hippocampus toward quinolinic acid (QA), which led to glutamate-mediated  hyperactivation of mossy cells (MCs) in hippocampal hilus. Furthermore, OD  impaired parvalbumin (PV) interneurons-related local circuits in the hippocampal  granule cell layer. These resulted in hippocampal neurogenesis deficits and  related behavioral dysfunction in mice. EPs supplementation ameliorated  OD-induced gut dysbiosis, as evidenced by inhibiting the expansion of Escherichia  coli (E.coli) and reducing the concentration of LPS in colonic contents and  serum, thereby inhibiting the subsequent neuroinflammation. In addition, oral EPs  suppressed the peripheral Kyn pathway to reduce the concentration of QA and  glutamic acid in the hippocampus of OD-fed mice, thereby rescuing the glutamic  acid-triggered neuroexcitotoxicity. These contributed to remodeling the rhythm of  hippocampal neurogenesis and mitigated behavioral dysfunction in OD-fed mice.  Conclusions: The present study addresses a gap in the understanding of neuronal  dysfunction associated with OD during adolescence and provides the first evidence  that EPs improved cognitive and social behavior via modulation of gut microbiota  and tryptophan metabolism in adolescent mice fed with OD, which may represent  novel preemptive therapy for neurodevelopmental disorders via manipulation of the  tryptophan metabolite.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety disorders have been linked to dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and structural changes within the hippocampus. Unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) can recapitulate these effects in a mouse model, and UCMS-induced changes, including downregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, can be reversed by antidepressant (AD) treatment. We investigated causality between changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and the effects of both chronic stress and chronic ADs. METHODS: Mice were treated with either a sham procedure or focal hippocampal irradiation to disrupt cell proliferation before being confronted with 5 weeks of UCMS. From the third week onward, we administered monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine), the corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF(1)) antagonist SSR125543, or the vasopressin 1b (V(1b)) antagonist SSR149415 daily. The effects of UCMS regimen, AD treatments, and irradiation were assessed by physical measures (coat state, weight), behavioral testing (Splash test, Novelty-Suppressed feeding test, locomotor activity), and hippocampal BrdU labeling. RESULTS: Our results show that elimination of hippocampal neurogenesis has no effect on animals' sensitivity to UCMS in several behavioral assays, suggesting that reduced neurogenesis is not a cause of stress-related behavioral deficits. Second, we present evidence for both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms for the reversal of stress-induced behaviors by AD drugs. Specifically, loss of neurogenesis completely blocked the effects of monoaminergic ADs (imipramine, fluoxetine) but did not prevent most effects of the CRF(1) and the V(1b) antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal neurogenesis might thus be used by the monoaminergic ADs to counteract the effects of stress, whereas similar effects could be achieved by directly targeting the HPA axis and related neuropeptides.},

  abstract = {Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) represents a remarkable form of neuroplasticity that has increasingly been linked to the stress response in recent years. However, the hippocampus does not itself support the expression of the different dimensions of the stress response. Moreover, the main hippocampal functions are essentially preserved under AHN depletion and adult-born immature neurons (abGNs) have no extrahippocampal projections, which questions the mechanisms by which abGNs influence functions supported by brain areas far from the hippocampus. Within this framework, we propose that through its computational influences AHN is pivotal in shaping adaption to environmental demands, underlying its role in stress response. The hippocampus with its high input convergence and output divergence represents a computational hub, ideally positioned in the brain (1) to detect cues and contexts linked to past, current and predicted stressful experiences, and (2) to supervise the expression of the stress response at the cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological levels. AHN appears to bias hippocampal computations toward enhanced conjunctive encoding and pattern separation, promoting contextual discrimination and cognitive flexibility, reducing proactive interference and generalization of stressful experiences to safe contexts. These effects result in gating downstream brain areas with more accurate and contextualized information, enabling the different dimensions of the stress response to be more appropriately set with specific contexts. Here, we first provide an integrative perspective of the functional involvement of AHN in the hippocampus and a phenomenological overview of the stress response. We then examine the mechanistic underpinning of the role of AHN in the stress response and describe its potential implications in the different dimensions accompanying this response.},

  abstract = {Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth., Rubiaceae) is a plant native to Southeast Asia, where it has been used for centuries as a mild stimulant and as medicine for various ailments. More recently, as kratom has gained popularity in the West, United States federal agencies have raised concerns over its safety leading to criminalization in some states and cities. Some of these safety concerns have echoed across media and broad-based health websites and, in the absence of clinical trials to test kratom’s efficacy and safety, considerable confusion has arisen among healthcare providers. There is, however, a growing literature of peer-reviewed science that can inform healthcare providers so that they are better equipped to discuss kratom use with consumers and people considering kratom use within the context of their overall health and safety, while recognizing that neither kratom nor any of its constituent substances or metabolites have been approved as safe and effective for any disease. An especially important gap in safety-related science is the use of kratom in combination with physiologically active substances and medicines. With these caveats in mind we provide a comprehensive overview of the available science on kratom that has the potential to i clarity for healthcare providers and patients. We conclude by making recommendations for best practices in working with people who use kratom.},

  abstract = {Microglia are ramified cells that exhibit highly motile processes, which continuously survey the brain parenchyma and react to any insult to the CNS homeostasis. Although microglia have long been recognized as a crucial player in generating and maintaining inflammatory responses in the CNS, now it has become clear, that their function are much more diverse, particularly in the healthy brain. The innate immune response and phagocytosis represent only a little segment of microglia functional repertoire that also includes maintenance of biochemical homeostasis, neuronal circuit maturation during development and experience-dependent remodeling of neuronal circuits in the adult brain. Being equipped by numerous receptors and cell surface molecules microglia can perform bidirectional interactions with other cell types in the CNS. There is accumulating evidence showing that neurons inform microglia about their status and thus are capable of controlling microglial activation and motility while microglia also modulate neuronal activities. This review addresses the topic: how microglia communicate with other cell types in the brain, including fractalkine signaling, secreted soluble factors and extracellular vesicles. We summarize the current state of knowledge of physiological role and function of microglia during brain development and in the mature brain and further highlight microglial contribution to brain pathologies such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor as well as neuropsychiatric diseases (depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).},

  abstract = {Depression has been associated with reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. In addition, animal studies suggest an association between reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior. These associations were predominantly established based on responses to antidepressant drugs and alterations in BDNF levels and neurogenesis in depressive patients or animal models for depressive behavior. Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence that the actual reduction of the BDNF protein in specific brain sites can induce depressive-like behaviors or affect neurogenesis in vivo. Using BDNF knockdown by RNA interference and lentiviral vectors injected into specific subregions of the hippocampus we show that a reduction in BDNF expression in the dentate gyrus, but not the CA3, reduces neurogenesis and affects behaviors associated with depression. Moreover, we show that BDNF has a critical function in neuronal differentiation, but not proliferation in vivo. Finally, we found that a specific BDNF knockdown in the ventral subiculum induces anhedonic-like behavior. These findings provide substantial support for the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression and specify anatomical and neurochemical targets for potential antidepressant interventions. Moreover, the specific effect of BDNF reduction on neuronal differentiation has broader implications for the study of neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases.},

However, the mechanisms underlying these antidepressant effects of running exercise remain relatively unclear. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between depressive symptoms in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model rats treated with running exercise and changes in oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. After 4 weeks of CUS, the model group was randomly divided into a CUS standard group (18 rats) and a CUS running group (15 rats). Then, a 4-week treadmill running trial was performed with the CUS running group. In addition, the behavioral effects of exercise were investigated by means of a sucrose preference test (SPT) and an at the end of the 8th week. Immunohistochemical methods and modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-positive (CNPase + ) oligodendrocytes in each hippocampal subregion. At the behavioral level, after four weeks of running, the CUS running group displayed significantly higher consumption of sucrose water in the SPT than the CUS standard group. Unbiased stereological analyses revealed significantly higher total numbers of CNPase + cells in the hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus regions in the CUS running group than in the CUS standard group, whereas there was no significant difference between the groups in the number of CNPase + cells in the hippocampal CA1 region. The present results further confirm that exercise can alleviate symptoms and protect hippocampal oligodendrocytes in depressed rats.},

  abstract = {Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) systems have been meaningfully linked to the clinical phenomena of mood disorders, 15–35\% of patients do not respond to multiple SSRI interventions or even experience an exacerbation of their condition. As we previously showed, both running exercise and fluoxetine reversed depression-like behavior. However, whether exercise reverses depression-like behavior more quickly than fluoxetine treatment and whether this rapid effect is achieved via the promotion of oligodendrocyte differentiation and/or myelination in the hippocampus was previously unknown. Sixty male C57BL/6\,J mice were used in the present study. We subjected mice with unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) to a 4-week running exercise trial (UCS\,+\,RN) or intraperitoneally injected them with fluoxetine (UCS\,+\,FLX) to address these uncertainties. At the behavioral level, mice in the UCS\,+\,RN group consumed significantly more sugar water in the sucrose preference test (SPT) at the end of the 7th week than those in the UCS group, while those in the UCS\,+\,FLX group consumed significantly more sugar water than mice in the UCS group at the end of the 8th week. The unbiased stereological results and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that running exercise, and not fluoxetine treatment, increased the numbers of CC1+ and CC1+/Olig2+/BrdU+ oligodendrocytes in the CA1 subfield in depressed mice exposed to UCS. Moreover, running exercise rather than fluoxetine increased the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) and the G-ratio of myelinated nerve fibers in the CA1 subfield in the UCS mouse model. Unlike fluoxetine, exercise promoted hippocampal myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation and thus has potential as a therapeutic strategy to reduce depression-like behaviors induced by UCS.},

  abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of the most sensitive regions to various brain insults due to the occurrence of neurogenesis in its subgranular zone. Thus, it may serve as a brain sensor to radiation exposure, chemical and biological toxins, alcohol abuse, smoking, drug treatments, hormone imbalances, stress, pain, hypoxia, brain trauma, malnutrition and aging. DG is also involved in the pathogenesis of multiple neurological and neuropsychological disorders including intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia. Over decades of research, our understanding regarding the function and physiology of the DG is ever-changing. While it is commonly believed that the dentate granule cells are primarily responsible for executing higher brain functions such as learning and memory, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that the glial cells, particularly microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, are also involved in memory formation. Therefore, a book that systematically reviews DG structure, function and health implications is needed to update clinicians and researchers with state-of-the-art knowledge. In the first three chapters of this book, the recent progresses in the study of DG development with relevant molecular mechanisms, the cytoarchitectonics of DG with laminar and sublaminar distribution of different types of neurons and glial cells, as well as afferent and efferent of the DG and their neurophysiological roles will be described respectively. In Chapters 4 and 5, DG as a brain sensor to radiation exposure, and pre- and post-natal radiation-induced DG damage and cognitive impairment will be reviewed accordingly. The involvement of DG in pathogenesis of neurological disorders including TLE and AD will be discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Finally, in the last two chapters, i.e., Chapters 8 and 9, the roles of DG in the development of neuropsychological disorders including MDD, PTSD and schizophrenia will be presented.},

When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.},

During their maturation process, these immature neurons exhibit unique properties that could underlie their ability to influence behavioral output. In particular, abGCs in the DG exhibit a period of heightened plasticity 4-6 weeks after birth that is mediated by GluN2B-expressing NMDA receptors. The functional contribution of this critical window to AD responsiveness is unclear. Here, we determined the behavioral and neurogenic responses to the AD fluoxetine (FLX) in mice lacking GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in abGCs. We found that these mice exhibited an attenuated response to FLX in a neurogenesis-dependent behavioral assay of FLX action, while neurogenesis-independent behaviors were unaffected by GluN2B deletion. In addition, deletion of GluN2B attenuated FLX-induced increases in dendritic complexity of abGCs suggesting that the blunted behavioral efficacy of FLX may be caused by impaired differentiation of young abGCs.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: 2-Bromoterguride, a dopamine D2 receptor partial agonist with antagonist properties at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors and α2C-adrenoceptors, meets the prerequisites of a putative atypical antipsychotic drug (APD). We recently showed that 2-bromoterguride is effective in tests of positive symptoms of schizophrenia in rats without inducing extrapyramidal side effects or metabolic changes. OBJECTIVE: In continuation of our recent work, we now investigated the effect of 2-bromoterguride on apomorphine and phencyclidine (PCP)-induced disruptions of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, a measure of sensory gating. In addition, we used subchronic PCP treatment to produce cognitive deficits and social aversion, and assessed the effect of 2-bromoterguride on the performance in the novel object recognition (NOR) task (model for studying cognitive deficit symptoms of schizophrenia) and the social interaction test (model for studying negative symptoms of schizophrenia). Finally, we extended the side effect profile of 2-bromoterguride by measuring the prolactin response to systemic administration of the drug in rats. RESULTS: Treatment with 2-bromoterguride (0.1 and 0.3~mg/kg) reversed PPI deficits induced by apomorphine and PCP, respectively. Subchronic PCP induced impairments in object memory and social interaction behavior which were ameliorated by 2-bromoterguride but not by clozapine and aripiprazole, respectively. Prolactin concentration in blood serum was not elevated at 1, 2, or 4~h post-2-bromoterguride treatment, which further supports the safe and effective use of this drug. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support 2-bromoterguride as a promising APD candidate due to its beneficial effect on cognitive impairments and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.},

The impact of developing GCs on the activity of preexisting dentate circuits remains unknown. Here we~combine optogenetics, acute slice electrophysiology, and in~vivo chemogenetics to activate GCs at different stages of maturation to study the recruitment of local target networks. We show that immature (4-week-old) GCs can efficiently drive distal CA3 targets but poorly activate proximal interneurons responsible for feedback inhibition (FBI). As new GCs transition toward maturity, they reliably recruit GABAergic feedback loops that restrict spiking of neighbor GCs, a mechanism that would promote sparse coding. Such inhibitory loop impinges only weakly in new cohorts of young GCs. A computational model reveals that the delayed coupling of new GCs to FBI could be crucial to achieve a fine-grain representation of novel inputs in the dentate gyrus.},

  abstract = {Associative memories guide behavioural adaptation by binding together outcome-predictive sensory stimuli1,2. However, in a feature-rich environment, only a subset of stimuli may predict a desired outcome3,4. How neural circuits enable behavioural adaptation by selectively and durably representing subsets of sensory stimuli that are\&nbsp;pertinent to a specific outcome is not known. We investigated this feature selection process in the hippocampus during memory acquisition and subsequent consolidation. Two-photon calcium imaging of CA3 axonal projections to CA1 combined with simultaneous local field potential recordings revealed that CA3 projections that encode behaviourally informative sensory stimuli were selectively recruited during the memory replay events that underlie hippocampal memory consolidation5. These axonal projections formed sequential assemblies that\&nbsp;conjunctively link sensory features to spatial location and thus reward proximity. By contrast, axons encoding uninformative, peripatetic sensory cues were notably suppressed during memory replay. Thus, while the hippocampus comprehensively encodes the real-time sensory environment, it implements a flexible filtering mechanism to maximize the utility of memories destined for long-term storage. We propose that\&nbsp;utility-dependent recruitment of sensory experience during memory consolidation is a general coding principle for associative learning. In memory consolidation, the hippocampus has a unique way to preferentially amplify behaviour-relevant information that entails ‘replaying’ this information during periods of rest.},

To understand the contribution of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia, we studied postmortem human samples. We found that adult-born dentate granule cells showed abnormal morphological development and changes in the expression of differentiation markers. The ratio of quiescent to proliferating hippocampal neural stem cells shifted, and the homeostasis of the neurogenic niche was altered. Aging and neurodegenerative diseases reduced the phagocytic capacity of microglia, triggered astrogliosis, and altered the microvasculature of the dentate gyrus. Thus, enhanced vulnerability of AHN to neurodegeneration might underlie hippocampal dysfunction during physiological and pathological aging in humans.},

  abstract = {Humans and non-human animals show great flexibility in spatial navigation, including the ability to return to specific locations based on as few as one single experience. To study spatial navigation in the laboratory, watermaze tasks, in which rats have to find a hidden platform in a pool of cloudy water surrounded by spatial cues, have long been used. Analogous tasks have been developed for human participants using virtual environments. Spatial learning in the watermaze is facilitated by the hippocampus. In particular, rapid, one-trial, allocentric place learning, as measured in the delayed-matching-to-place variant of the watermaze task, which requires rodents to learn repeatedly new locations in a familiar environment, is hippocampal dependent. In this article, we review some computational principles, embedded within a reinforcement learning framework, that utilise hippocampal spatial representations for navigation in watermaze tasks. We consider which key elements underlie their efficacy, and discuss their limitations in accounting for hippocampus-dependent navigation, both in terms of behavioural performance (i.e. how well do they reproduce behavioural measures of rapid place learning) and neurobiological realism (i.e. how well do they map to neurobiological substrates involved in rapid place learning). We discuss how an actor–critic architecture, enabling simultaneous assessment of the value of the current location and of the optimal direction to follow, can reproduce one-trial place learning performance as shown on watermaze and virtual delayed-matching-to-place tasks by rats and humans, respectively, if complemented with map-like place representations. The contribution of actor–critic mechanisms to delayed-matching-to-place performance is consistent with neurobiological findings implicating the striatum and hippocampo-striatal interaction in delayed-matching-to-place performance, given that the striatum has been associated with actor–critic mechanisms. Moreover, we illustrate that hierarchical computations embedded within an actor–critic architecture may help to account for aspects of flexible spatial navigation. The hierarchical reinforcement learning approach separates trajectory control via a temporal-difference error from goal selection via a goal prediction error and may account for flexible, trial-specific, navigation to familiar goal locations, as required in some arm-maze place memory tasks, although it does not capture one-trial learning of new goal locations, as observed in open field, including watermaze and virtual, delayed-matching-to-place tasks. Future models of one-shot learning of new goal locations, as observed on delayed-matching-to-place tasks, should incorporate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that integrate new goal information with allocentric place representation, as such mechanisms are supported by substantial empirical evidence.},

The precise nature of the hippocampal role in the storage of information has, however, remained elusive. Here it is proposed that the role of the hippocampus is to form and retain an index of neocortical areas activated by experiential events. The hippocampal index, thus, represents those unique cortical regions activated by specific events. The neuronal mechanism underlying the memory index is hypothesized to be long-term potentiation. It is asserted that the reactivation of the stored hippocampal memory index will serve to also reactivate the associated unique array of neocortical areas and thus will result in a memorial experience. This hippocampal reactivation of a neocortical array may also be involved in establishing a cortically based memory trace.},

The 5-HT3 receptor binding site is comprised of six loops from two adjacent subunits, and critical ligand binding amino acids in these loops have been largely identified. There are a range of selective agonists and antagonists for these receptors and the pharmacophore is reasonably well understood. There are also a wide range of compounds that can modulate receptor activity.

Currently, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) provide the only pharmacological monotherapy for OCD, but response rates are insufficient. Ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was reported to have rapid, sustained therapeutic effects in OCD patients. However, the mechanisms remain unknown. Objectives: Here, we aimed to provide a platform for investigating mechanisms underlying anti-OCD effects of ketamine treatment by assessing whether ketamine pretreatment could alleviate 5-HT1B receptor (5-HT1BR)-induced OCD-like behavior in mice. Methods: We assessed whether acute ketamine (0, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg), administered at two pretreatment time points (30 min, 24 h), would modulate 5-HT1BR-induced OCD-like behavior in mice. Behavioral measures were perseverative hyperlocomotion in the open field and deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) induced by acute pharmacological 5-HT1BR challenge. Results: Three milligrams per kilogram of ketamine reduced 5-HT1BR-induced perseverative hyperlocomotion, but not PPI deficits, 24 h postinjection. In contrast, higher doses of ketamine were either ineffective (10 mg/kg) or exacerbated (30 mg/kg) 5-HT1BR-induced perseverative hyperlocomotion 30 min postinjection. At 24 h postinjection, 30 mg/kg ketamine reduced perseverative hyperlocomotion across all groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the 5-HT1BR-induced model of OCD-like behavior is sensitive to a low dose of ketamine, a potential fast-acting anti-OCD treatment, and may provide a tool for studying mechanisms underlying the rapid therapeutic effects of ketamine in OCD patients.},

  abstract = {Cognitive flexibility helps organisms to respond adaptively to environmental changes. Deficits in this executive function have been associated with a variety of brain disorders, and it has been shown to rely on various concomitant neurobiological mechanisms. However, the involvement of the glutamatergic system in general, and NMDA receptors in particular, has been debated. Therefore, we injected C57BL/6 mice repeatedly with low-doses of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine, 0.1\,mg/kg, i.p.). Reversal learning and the use of specific cognitive strategies were assessed in a non-spatial discrimination touchscreen task and the Morris water maze (MWM) spatial learning task. In addition, mice were subjected to a non-mnemonic test battery. Although initial acquisition learning was not affected by MK-801 administration, it did induce deficits in reversal learning, both in the non-spatial and spatial task. Defects in non-spatial reversal learning appeared to be caused by perseverative errors. Also, MK-801 administration induced perseverative behaviours as well as inefficient spatial strategy use during MWM reversal learning. These effects could not be reduced to changes in exploratory (anxiety-related) behaviours, nor to motor deficits. This was consistent with results in the non-mnemonic test battery, during which MK-801 evoked hyperlocomotion and subtle motor defects, but failed to alter general motor activity and exploratory behaviours. In conclusion, NMDA receptors appear to be involved in the flexible cognitive processes that underlie reversal learning in spatial as well as non-spatial tasks. Our results also indicate that reversal learning as well as the use of cognitively demanding strategies are more sensitive to NMDA receptor blockage than some other functions that have been suggested to be NMDA receptor dependent.},

Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus (HC) have been involved in cognitive flexibility, but the interaction between these structures might be of particular functional significance. We applied a disconnection model in C57BL/6JRj mice to investigate the importance of OFC and ventral HC (vHC) interaction. Spatial acquisition and reversal performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) was compared between animals with small contralateral excitotoxic lesions to OFC and vHC, ipsilateral lesions (i.e., OFC-vHC lesions in the same hemisphere), as well as small bilateral OFC or vHC lesions. Spatial learning and memory performance was mostly unimpaired or only slightly impaired in our brain-lesioned animals compared to sham-lesioned control mice. However, contralaterally lesioned mice were significantly impaired during the early phase of reversal learning, whereas the other lesion groups performed similar to controls. These mice might also have experienced some difficulties using cognitively advanced search strategies.

  abstract = {Regulation of Aberrant Protein Production (RAPP) is a protein quality control in mammalian cells. RAPP degrades mRNAs of nascent proteins not able to associate with their natural interacting partners during synthesis at the ribosome. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the pathway, its substrates, or its specificity. The Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) is the first interacting partner for secretory proteins. It recognizes signal sequences of the nascent polypeptides when they are exposed from the ribosomal exit tunnel. Here, we reveal the generality of the RAPP pathway on the whole transcriptome level through depletion of human SRP54, an SRP subunit. This depletion triggers RAPP and leads to decreased expression of the mRNAs encoding a number of secretory and membrane proteins. The loss of SRP54 also leads to the dramatic upregulation of a specific network of HSP70/40/90 chaperones (HSPA1A, DNAJB1, HSP90AA1, and others), increased ribosome associated ubiquitination, and change in expression of RPS27 and RPS27L suggesting ribosome rearrangement. These results demonstrate the complex nature of defects in protein trafficking, mRNA and protein quality control, and provide better understanding of their mechanisms at the ribosome.},

Twenty years ago, Gallagher, Burwell, and Burchinal (1993) reported new variables and measures, including a spatial learning index, that greatly enhanced the utility of the Morris water maze for assessing subtle differences in performance on the task. The learning index provided a single number that could be used to elucidate neurobiological measures of hippocampal dysfunction, for example, correlation of learning performance with a biomarker of aging. In this review, as part of the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Behavioral Neuroscience, we describe how the spatial learning index has contributed to the field of learning and memory, how it has advanced our understanding of normal and pathological cognitive aging, and how it has contributed to translation of findings into other species. Finally, we provide instruction into how the learning index can be extended to other tasks and data sets. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

For decades, researchers have attempted to identify the brain regions in which memory is formed and to follow its changes across time. The theory of systems consolidation of memory (SCM) suggests that changes in circuitry and brain networks are required for the maintenance of a memory with time. Various mechanisms by which such changes may take place have been hypothesized. Recently, several studies have provided insight into the brain networks driving SCM through the characterization of memory engram cells, their biochemical and physiological changes and the circuits in which they operate. In this Review, we place these findings in the context of the field and describe how they have led to a revamped understanding of SCM in the brain.},

However, whether this happens in endogenous microglia with no genetic intervention remains unclear. Here, we addressed this issue in mice treated with different types of chronic stresses, including the CUS, chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Results showed that the cellular numbers, process lengths, soma areas and activation markers of endogenous hippocampal but not cortical microglia, were markedly reduced by CUS, CRS and CSDS treatment. Administration of mice with two classical stimulators of microglia, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), reversed the CUS-, CRS- and CSDS-induced reductions in endogenous hippocampal microglial numbers, and also improved the CUS-, CRS- or CSDS-induced behavioral abnormalities, including the increases in the immobile time in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, the inhibition of sucrose preference, and the decrease in the time spent in the center of open field. Furthermore, inhibition of the initial activation of hippocampal microglia by minocycline pretreatment also reversed the reduction in hippocampal microglial numbers as well as the behavioral abnormalities induced by CUS, CRS and CSDS treatment. These results provide compelling evidences to show that different types of chronic stresses can trigger the loss of endogenous hippocampal microglia and restoration of microglial numbers may have therapeutic values in major depression.},

Here we explored the mechanisms of synaptogenesis on neurons born in the adult mouse hippocampus using confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and live imaging. We report that new neurons, similar to mature granule neurons, were contacted by axosomatic, axodendritic and axospinous synapses. Consistent with their putative role in synaptogenesis, dendritic filopodia were more abundant during the early stages of maturation and, when analyzed in three dimensions, the tips of all filopodia were found within 200 nm of preexisting boutons that already synapsed on other neurons. Furthermore, dendritic spines primarily synapsed on multiple-synapse boutons, suggesting that initial contacts were preferentially made with preexisting boutons already involved in a synapse. The connectivity of new neurons continued to change until at least 2 months, long after the formation of the first dendritic protrusions.},

Neurons born in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus undergo a series of events before they fully integrate in the network and eventually become undistinguishable from neurons born during embryogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly regulated by neuronal activity and neurotransmitters, and the synaptic integration of adult-born neurons occurs in discrete steps, some of which are very different from perinatal synaptogenesis. Here, we review the current knowledge on the development of the synaptic input and output of neurons born in the adult hippocampus, from the stem/progenitor cell to the fully mature neuron. We also provide insight on the regulation of adult neurogenesis by some neurotransmitters and discuss some specificities of the integration of new neurons in an adult environment. The understanding of the mechanisms regulating the synaptic integration of adult-born neurons is not only crucial for our understanding of brain plasticity, but also provides a framework for the manipulation and monitoring of endogenous adult neurogenesis as well as grafted cells, for potential therapeutic applications.},

MacLean, called it the limbic lobe, although now there is more current terminology used for the individual structures included in this region. Eventually, this region became understood to have links to emotional, memory, and motivational processes that connect to other parts of the brain. Clinically, some specific disorders occur when parts of the limbic system suffer a lesion. While a full understanding of the limbic system is far from complete, advances in neurosciences have still given a better understanding of the role the individual components of the limbic system play, and some insight into their many connections.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies of illness progression in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that the onset of subsequent depressive episodes becomes increasingly decoupled from external stressors. A possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that multiple episodes induce long-lasting neurobiological changes that confer increased risk for recurrence. Prior morphometric studies have frequently reported volumetric reductions in patients with MDD--especially in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus--but few studies have investigated whether these changes are exacerbated by prior episodes. METHODS: In a sample of 103 medication-free patients with depression and control subjects with no history of depression, structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed to examine relationships between number of prior episodes, current stress, hippocampal subfield volume and cortical thickness. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus were performed using a recently validated subfield segmentation approach, and cortical thickness estimates were obtained using vertex-based methods. Participants were grouped on the basis of the number of prior depressive episodes and current depressive diagnosis. RESULTS: Number of prior episodes was associated with both lower reported stress levels and reduced volume in the dentate gyrus. Cortical thinning of the left mPFC was associated with a greater number of prior depressive episodes but not current depressive diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings are consistent with preclinical models suggesting that the dentate gyrus and mPFC are especially vulnerable to stress exposure and provide evidence for morphometric changes that are consistent with stress-sensitization models of recurrence in MDD.},

  abstract = {For decades, behavioral scientists have used the matching law to quantify how animals distribute their choices between multiple options in response to reinforcement they receive. More recently, many reinforcement learning (RL) models have been developed to explain choice by integrating reward feedback over time. Despite reasonable success of RL models in capturing choice on a trial-by-trial basis, these models cannot capture variability in matching~behavior. To address this, we developed metrics based on information theory and applied them to choice data from dynamic learning tasks in mice and monkeys. We found that a single entropy-based metric can explain 50\% and 41\% of variance in matching in mice and monkeys, respectively. We then used limitations of existing RL models in capturing entropy-based metrics to construct more accurate models of choice. Together, our entropy-based metrics provide a model-free tool to predict adaptive choice behavior and reveal underlying neural mechanisms.},

  abstract = {New dentate granule cells (GCs) are generated in the hippocampus throughout life. These adult-born neurons are required for spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM). In rats, spatial learning shapes the network by regulating their number and dendritic development. Here, we explored whether such modulatory effects exist in mice. New GCs were tagged using thymidine analogs or a GFP-expressing retrovirus. Animals were exposed to a reference memory protocol for 10–14 days (spaced training) at different times after newborn cells labeling. Cell proliferation, cell survival, cell death, neuronal phenotype, and dendritic and spine development were examined using immunohistochemistry. Surprisingly, spatial learning did not modify any of the parameters under scrutiny including cell number and dendritic morphology. These results suggest that although new GCs are required in mice for spatial learning in the MWM, they are, at least for the developmental intervals analyzed here, refractory to behavioral stimuli generated in the course of learning in the MWM. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) non-selective antagonist, ketamine, has been recently repurposed as a rapidly acting antidepressant, catalyzing the vigorous investigation of glutamate-signaling modulators as novel therapeutic agents for depressive disorders. Beneficial effects of this drug in the quick-acting treatment of depression are recognized. The long-term effects of ketamine have not been known, including the cognitive sphere. It is well acknowledged that prolonged exposure to stress induces depression and cognitive impairment. It seemed reasonable to ask how the long-term ketamine administration would affect stressed animals in the aspect of cognitive functions. In the current study we tested whether it is possible for ketamine, used in prolonged-regimen in rats, to alleviate stress-evoked memory deficits? Stressed (restraint 2 h daily for 21 days) and non-stressed rats (6-weeks-old) were treated with ketamine for 21 days and next subjected to a battery of behavioral tests: for the assessment of working and reference spatial memory (Morris water maze (MWM) and Barnes maze (BM)), stereotypy (stereotypy test - ST), locomotor functions (Open field - OF) and anxiety behavior (Elevated plus maze - EPM). Ketamine administration resulted in a significant stereotype behaviour in rats tested in ST. Stressed rats displayed a significant decline in the spatial working and reference memory. The effect of chronic ketamine administration depended on the type of test and differed between control rats and animals simultaneously exposed to chronic stress. However, in the MWM the impact was quite unequivocal, as we observed an improvement in spatial memory in stressed animals and a deterioration in non-stressed animals after ketamine administration. In the BM, the effect of ketamine changed in successive attempts, from favorable in the initial period to negative at the end of the test in the group of stressed animals and without a significant impact on control animals. We found no significant effects of ketamine on locomotor performance and on the level of anxiety. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ketamine potently abolishes or prevents some kinds of stress-induced memory impairments and cognitive decline in rats, although in some circumstances, it could even increase damage to memory, especially in unstressed animals. It seems that the prolonged use of ketamine in the prevention of stress-induced memory declines can fulfill its role.},

Since the onset and severity of these disorders have been found to be closely related to stressful life events, and as stress alone has been shown to reduce hippocampal volume in animal studies, vulnerability to mood disorders may be related to a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal shrinkage. However, a smaller hippocampal volume before stress exposure has also been suggested to confer vulnerability of stressed individuals to PTSD or depression. In this study, we examined the contribution of either innate hippocampal volume differences or hippocampal susceptibility to stress-induced shrinkage to the formation of stress-related psychopathology using longitudinal MRI measurements of hippocampal volume in inbred C57 mice before and after chronic social defeat stress. We found that only half of the stressed C57 mice were susceptible to stress and developed psychopathological behaviors such as social avoidance. The other half was resilient to stress and exhibited no social avoidance. Before exposure to stress, we observed a positive correlation between hippocampal volume and social avoidance. After chronic social defeat stress, we found significant increases in left hippocampal volume in resilient and nonstressed control mice. Intriguingly, this increase in hippocampal volume was not found in susceptible mice, suggesting an arrestment of hippocampal growth in these mice. Our findings suggest that both a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal volume changes and a larger hippocampus before stress exposure confer vulnerability to psychopathology after chronic stress.},

The Morris Water Maze (MWM) is the most widely-employed laboratory behavioral test for assessing cognitive deficits in rodents after experimental TBI. Numerous protocols exist for performing the test, which has shown great robustness in detecting learning and memory deficits in rodents after infliction of TBI. We review applications of the MWM for the study of cognitive deficits following TBI in pre-clinical studies, describing multiple ways in which the test can be employed to examine specific aspects of learning and memory. Emphasis is placed on dependent measures that are available and important controls that must be considered in the context of TBI. Finally, caution is given regarding interpretation of deficits as being indicative of dysfunction of a single brain region (hippocampus), as experimental models of TBI most often result in more diffuse damage that disrupts multiple neural pathways and larger functional networks that participate in complex behaviors required in MWM performance.},

The neurogenic hypothesis proposes that MDD is linked to impairments of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), while the effects of antidepressants are mediated by increased neurogenesis. However, alterations in neurogenesis and endophenotypes are not always causally linked, and the relationship between increased neurogenesis and altered behavior is controversial. To address causality, we used chemogenetics in transgenic mice to selectively manipulate activity of newborn DG neurons. Suppressing excitability of newborn neurons without altering neurogenesis abolish the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine. Remarkably, activating these neurons is sufficient to alleviate depression-like behavior and reverse the adverse effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress. Our results demonstrate a direct causal relationship between newborn neuronal activity and affective behavior. Thus, strategies that target not only neurogenesis but also activity of newborn neurons may lead to more effective antidepressants., It is unclear if there is a causal link between increased neurogenesis and altered affective behaviors in major depressive disorders. Here, the authors show that selectively suppressing the excitability of newborn neurons, without altering neurogenesis, abolishes the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine.},

  abstract = {Major depression is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include hopelessness and anhedonia. Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation– are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant, and certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons. Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.}

Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation– are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant, and certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons. Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.},

During behavioural experiments, mice frequently experience human contact. However, the effects of repeated handling on mice behaviour remains unclear. To minimise mice stress, methods of moving mice using transparent tunnels or cups have been recommended but are impractical in behavioural tests. To investigate these effects, we used a behavioural test battery to assess differences between mice accustomed to the experimenter’s handling versus control mice. Repeatedly handled mice gained slightly more weight than control mice. In behavioural tests, repeatedly handled mice showed improved spatial cognition in the Y-maze test and reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze test. However, there was no change in anxiety-like behaviour in the light/dark transition test or open-field test. Grip strength, rotarod, sociability, tail suspension, Porsolt forced swim, and passive avoidance tests revealed no significant differences between repeatedly handled and control mice. Our findings demonstrated that mice repeatedly handled by the experimenter before behavioural tests showed reduced anxiety about high altitudes and improved spatial cognition, suggesting that repeated contact can affect the results of some behavioural tests.},

  abstract = {We use topological data analysis as a tool to analyze the fit of mathematical models to experimental data. This study is built on data obtained from motion tracking groups of aphids in [Nilsen et al., PLOS One, 2013] and two random walk models that were proposed to describe the data. One model incorporates social interactions between the insects via a functional dependence on an aphid’s distance to its nearest neighbor. The second model is a control model that ignores this dependence. We compare data from each model to data from experiment by performing statistical tests based on three different sets of measures. First, we use time series of order parameters commonly used in collective motion studies. These order parameters measure the overall polarization and angular momentum of the group, and do not rely on a priori knowledge of the models that produced the data. Second, we use order parameter time series that do rely on a priori knowledge, namely average distance to nearest neighbor and percentage of aphids moving. Third, we use computational persistent homology to calculate topological signatures of the data. Analysis of the a priori order parameters indicates that the interactive model better describes the experimental data than the control model does. The topological approach performs as well as these a priori order parameters and better than the other order parameters, suggesting the utility of the topological approach in the absence of specific knowledge of mechanisms underlying the data.},

  abstract = {The network hypothesis of depression proposes that mood disorders reflect problems in information processing within particular neural networks. Antidepressants (AD), including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), function by gradually improving information processing within these networks. AD have been shown to induce a state of juvenile-like plasticity comparable to that observed during developmental critical periods: Such critical-period-like plasticity allows brain networks to better adapt to extrinsic and intrinsic signals. We have coined this drug-induced state of juvenile-like plasticity 'iPlasticity.' A combination of iPlasticity induced by chronic SSRI treatment together with training, rehabilitation, or psychotherapy improves symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders and issues underlying the developmentally or genetically malfunctioning networks. We have proposed that iPlasticity might be a critical component of AD action. We have demonstrated that iPlasticity occurs in the visual cortex, fear erasure network, extinction of aggression caused by social isolation, and spatial reversal memory in rodent models. Chronic SSRI treatment is known to promote neurogenesis and to cause dematuration of granule cells in the dentate gyrus and of interneurons, especially parvalbumin interneurons enwrapped by perineuronal nets in the prefrontal cortex, visual cortex, and amygdala. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), via its receptor tropomyosin kinase receptor B, is involved in the processes of synaptic plasticity, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, weight of synapses, and gene regulation of synaptic formation. BDNF can be activated by both chronic SSRI treatment and neuronal activity. Accordingly, the BDNF/tropomyosin kinase receptor B pathway is critical for iPlasticity, but further analyses will be needed to provide mechanical insight into the processes of iPlasticity.},

We and others have previously reported that diverse stimulation protocols, or different memory-inducing procedures, enhance the expression of endoplasmic reticulum-resident Ca               2+               release channels in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cells or hippocampal tissue.                                         Methods and Results:               Here, we report that induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by Theta burst stimulation protocols of the CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapse increased the mRNA and protein levels of type-2 Ryanodine Receptor (RyR2) Ca               2+               release channels in rat hippocampal slices. Suppression of RyR channel activity (1 h preincubation with 20 μM ryanodine) abolished both LTP induction and the enhanced expression of these channels; it also promoted an increase in the surface expression of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 and caused a moderate but significant reduction of dendritic spine density. In addition, training rats in the Morris water maze induced memory consolidation, which lasted for several days after the end of the training period, accompanied by an increase in the mRNA levels and the protein content of the RyR2 channel isoform.                                         Discussion:               We confirm in this work that LTP induction by TBS protocols requires functional RyR channels. We propose that the increments in the protein content of RyR2 Ca               2+               release channels, induced by LTP or spatial memory training, play a significant role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {The authors examined spatial working memory in the Morris water maze during the activity and rest periods ofWistar rats. Wheel-running activity was measured continuously as a marker of circadian phase. To minimize possible masking effects on performance, animals were placed in constant dim light the day before testing and tested in similar light conditions. Three experiments were run, each of them using animals varying in their previous experience in the water maze. Half of the animals of each experiment were tested 2 to 3 h after activity onset (active group), and the other half were tested 14 to 15 h after activity onset (inactive group). In the three experiments, a significant phase effect was observed in the animals? performance in the water maze; animals tested in the active phase showed steeper acquisition curves. These phase effects on performance are due to the animals? search pattern and not to a better acquisition and maintenance of spatial information; rats tested in the inactive phase found the platform faster on the first trial of the test, when the information on the location of the platform had not been presented to the animals. This effect vanished as the amount of training in the pool increased. Finally, swimming speed also showed a temporal effect, suggesting the existence of a phase effect for motivation to escape from the water; rats tested during their inactive phase tended to swim faster. All together, the data suggest a modulating effect of the biological clock on performance in the water maze, particularly when the animals are less experienced.},

With the rapid expansion of questions to be addressed and scientific information produced, there is a growing workload on reviewers, making the current practice unsustainable without the aid of automation tools. While many automation tools have been developed and are available, uptake seems to be lagging. For this reason, we set out to investigate the current level of uptake and what the potential barriers and facilitators are for the adoption of automation tools in systematic reviews. We deployed surveys among systematic reviewers that gathered information on tool uptake, demographics, systematic review characteristics, and barriers and facilitators for uptake. Systematic reviewers from multiple domains were targeted during recruitment; however, responders were predominantly from the biomedical sciences. We found that automation tools are currently not widely used among the participants. When tools are used, participants mostly learn about them from their environment, for example, through colleagues, peers, or organization. Tools are often chosen on the basis of user experience, either by own experience or from colleagues or peers. Lastly, licensing, steep learning curve, lack of support, and mismatch to workflow are often reported by participants as relevant barriers. While conclusions can only be drawn for the biomedical field, our work provides evidence and confirms the conclusions and recommendations of previous work, which was based on expert opinions. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance that organizations and best practices in a field can have for the uptake of automation tools for systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {The Morris water maze task is a widely used tool to assess hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in rodents. Performance depends upon several factors including not only the traits of the experimental animals, but also apparatus and protocol characteristics. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of maze diameter on acquisition and probe trial performance in three commonly used strains: C57Bl/6, BALB/c, and 129/SvEvBrd mice. Three maze diameters (150, 120, and 75 cm) were used under identical protocol and testing conditions. Downscaling maze dimensions, hence reducing difficulty and stress levels, did not allow BALB/c mice, commonly known as poor learners, to acquire this visual-spatial learning task. C57Bl/6 mice performed satisfactory in all three maze settings, with superior probe trial performance in the 120-cm-diameter setting. Further downscaling of maze dimensions might even render this task too simple for this strain. If the 129S5/SvEvBrd background strain is preferred, testing of visual-spatial learning abilities should be performed in a small sized MWM pool, as this strain performed only adequately in the smallest maze setting. Attention is drawn to the importance of supplying a detailed description 129 substrain nomenclature in future studies. Generalization of observations from one strain to another and from data obtained with a specific strain and maze diameter to other maze dimensions should be dealt with very carefully. The present study emphasizes the importance of a well-substantiated choice of background strain and water maze characteristics when researchers plan to investigate visual-spatial learning and memory in a chemically/lesion-induced or targeted mutagenesis model. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely prescribed stimulant drug for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Its use in this age group raises concerns regarding the potential interference with ongoing neurodevelopmental processes. Particularly the hippocampus is a highly plastic brain region that continues to develop postnatally and is involved in cognition and emotional behavior, functions known to be affected by MPH. In this study, we assessed whether hippocampal structure and function were affected by chronic oral MPH treatment and whether its effects were different in adolescent or adult rats. Using behavioral testing, resting-state functional MRI, post-mortem structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and immunohistochemistry, we assessed MPH's effects on recognition memory, depressive-like behavior, topological features of functional connectivity networks, hippocampal shape and markers for hippocampal neurogenesis and proliferation. Object recognition memory was transiently impaired in adolescent treated rats, while in animals treated during adulthood, increased depressive-like behavior was observed. Neurogenesis was increased in adolescent treated rats, whereas cell proliferation was decreased following adult treatment. Adolescent treated rats showed inward shape deformations adjacent to ventral parahippocampal regions known to be involved in recognition memory, whereas such deformations were not observed in adult treated animals. Irrespective of the age of treatment, MPH affected topological features of ventral hippocampal functional networks. Thus, chronic oral treatment with a therapeutically relevant dose of MPH preferentially affected the ventral part of the hippocampus and induced contrasting effects in adolescent and adult rats. The differences in behavior were paralleled by opposite effects on adult neurogenesis and granule cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {Striking differences in the septo-temporal distribution of neurogenesis are found in small rodents. Here, we assessed the association of adult hippocampal neurogenesis with behavioral responses to novelty, temporal and spatial sequence and reversal learning in wild, wild-derived and laboratory rodents using an automated testing apparatus, the IntelliCage. Behaviorally, DBA/2 and wild-derived house mice were quickest to explore a novel environment, wild wood mice and bank voles were slowest, and C57BL/6 intermediate. Rule learning (temporal and spatial) was fastest in wood mice and bank voles, while DBA/2 and house mice performed poorer. C57BL/6 performed similar to the house mice in the temporal task and similar to wild rodents in the spatial task. Using the number of DCX-positive neurons and proliferating, Ki67-positive cells in the septal, intermediate and temporal hippocampus as a proxy, an ANCOVA was used to test for within-group relations between neurogenesis and behavior. We found that higher numbers of DCX-positive cells in the temporal hippocampus were associated with an increased latency and a lower frequency to explore a novel environment. Temporal and spatial sequence learning was not associated with neurogenesis. In the spatial reversal task however, animals with higher septal neurogenesis showed a persevering phenotype and slower re-learning. Our findings provide strong evidence of septo-temporally segregated neurogenesis effects on behavior across five rodent strains and species. While temporal neurogenesis covaries with behavioral responses to novelty, septal neurogenesis relates to perseverance of a successfully learned spatial rule. Importantly, these associations were independent of species or strain and can be found in both wild and domesticated rodents.},

  abstract = {This chapter considers mixed-model regression analysis, which is a specific technique for analyzing longitudinal data that properly deals with within- and between-subjects variance. The term ‘‘mixed model’’ refers to the inclusion of both fixed effects, which are model components used to define systematic relationships such as overall changes over time and/ or experimentally induced group differences; and random effects, which account for variability among subjects around the systematic relationships captured by the fixed effects. To illustrate how the mixed-model regression approach can help analyze longitudinal data with large inter-individual differences, the psychomotor vigilance data is considered from an experiment involving 88 h of total sleep deprivation, during which subjects received either sustained low-dose caffeine or placebo. The traditional repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied, and it is shown that that this method is not robust against systematic interindividual variability. The data are then reanalyzed using linear mixed-model regression analysis in order to properly take into account the interindividual differences. The study concludes with an application of nonlinear mixed-model regression analysis of the data at hand, to demonstrate the considerable potential of this relatively novel statistical approach.},

  abstract = {Stress and stress hormones are known to influence the function of the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for cognitive-map-based, allocentric spatial navigation. The caudate nucleus, a brain structure critical for stimulus–response-based, egocentric navigation, is not as sensitive to stress. Evidence for this comes from rodent studies, which show that acute stress or stress hormones impair allocentric, but not egocentric navigation. However, there have been few studies investigating the effect of acute stress on human spatial navigation, and the results of these have been equivocal. To date, no study has investigated whether acute stress can shift human navigational strategy selection between allocentric and egocentric navigation. The present study investigated this question by exposing participants to an acute psychological stressor (the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, PASAT), before testing navigational strategy selection in the Dual-Strategy Maze, a modified virtual Morris water maze. In the Dual-Strategy maze, participants can chose to navigate using a constellation of extra-maze cues (allocentrically) or using a single cue proximal to the goal platform (egocentrically). Surprisingly, PASAT stress biased participants to solve the maze allocentrically significantly more, rather than less, often. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of acute stress on cognitive function in general, and the function of the hippocampus in particular.},

  abstract = {Aggression in group-housed male mice is known to be influenced by both cage size and group size. However, the interdependency of these two parameters has not been studied yet. In this study, the level of aggression in groups of three, five, or eight male BALB/c mice housed in cages with a floor size of either 80 or 125 cm2/animal was estimated weekly after cage cleaning for a period of 14 weeks. Furthermore, urine corticosterone levels, food and water intake, body weight, and number of wounds were measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity, testosterone levels, and weight of spleen, thymus, testes, and seminal vesicles were determined. Results indicate a moderate increase of intermale aggression in larger cages when compared to the smaller cages. Aggression in groups of eight animals was considerably higher than in groups of three animals. The increase of agonistic behavior was observed both in dominant and subordinate animals. Physiological parameters indicate differences in stress levels between dominant and subordinate animals. It is concluded that aggressive behavior in group-housed male BALB/c mice is best prevented by housing the animals in small groups of three to five animals, while decreasing floor size per animal may be used as a temporary solution to decrease high levels of aggression in an existing social group. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Although various animal models are available, the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) has unique features and is therefore a preferred animal model. The mouse shares a remarkable genetic resemblance and aspects of behaviour with humans. In this review, first we describe common mouse models for behavioural analyses. As both genetic and environmental factors influence behavioural performance and need to be carefully evaluated in behavioural experiments, considerations for designing and interpretations of these experiments are subsequently discussed. Finally, common behavioural tests used to assess brain function are reviewed, and it is illustrated how behavioural tests are used to increase our understanding of the role of histaminergic neurotransmission in brain function.},

Border cells in RSC specifically encode walls, but not objects, and are sensitive to the animal’s direction to nearby borders. These egocentric representations are generated independent of visual or whisker sensation but are affected by inputs from MEC that contains allocentric spatial cells. Pharmaco- and optogenetic inhibition of MEC led to a disruption of border coding in RSC, but not vice versa, indicating allocentric-to-egocentric transformation. Finally, RSC border cells fire prospective to the animal’s next motion, unlike those in MEC, revealing the MEC-RSC pathway as an extended border coding circuit that implements coordinate transformation to guide navigation behavior.},

Activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is essential for psychedelic-induced cortical plasticity, but it is currently unclear why some 5-HT2AR agonists promote neuroplasticity, whereas others do not. We used molecular and genetic tools to demonstrate that intracellular 5-HT2ARs mediate the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics; these results explain why serotonin does not engage similar plasticity mechanisms. This work emphasizes the role of location bias in 5-HT2AR signaling, identifies intracellular 5-HT2ARs as a therapeutic target, and raises the intriguing possibility that serotonin might not be the endogenous ligand for intracellular 5-HT2ARs in the cortex.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Yet, it remains uncertain to what extent the SPT reflects other behavioral components, such as learning, memory, motivation, and choice. Here, we conducted an experimental and computational decomposition of mouse behavior in the SPT and discovered previously unrecognized behavioral subcomponents associated with changes in sucrose preference. We show that acute and chronic stress have sex-dependent effects on sucrose preference, but anhedonia was observed only in response to chronic stress in male mice. Additionally, reduced sucrose preference induced by optogenetics is not always indicative of anhedonia but can also reflect learning deficits. Even small variations in experimental conditions influence behavior, task outcome and interpretation. Thus, an ostensibly simple behavioral task can entail high levels of complexity, demonstrating the need for careful dissection of behavior into its subcomponents when studying the underlying neurobiology.},

  abstract = {The theta rhythm is the largest extracellular synchronous signal that can be recorded from the mammalian brain, and has been strongly implicated in mnemonic functions of the hippocampus. We advance the proposal that the theta rhythm represents a "tag" for short-term memory processing in the hippocampus. We propose that the hippocampus receives two main types of input, theta from ascending brainstem-diencephalo-septal systems and "information bearing" mainly from thalamocortical and cortical systems. The temporal convergence of activity of these two systems results in the encoding of information in the hippocampus, primarily reaching it via cortical routes. By analogy to processes associated with long-term potentiation (LTP), we suggest that theta represents a strong depolarizing influence on NMDA receptor-containing cells of the hippocampus. The temporal coupling of a theta-induced depolarization and the release of glutamate to these cells from intra- and extrahippocampal sources activates them. This, in turn, initiates processes leading to a (short-term) strengthening of connections between presynaptic ("information bearing") and postsynaptic neurons of the hippocampus. Theta is selectively present in the rat during active exploratory movements. During exploration, a rat continually gathers and updates information about its environment. If this information is temporally coupled to theta (as with the case of locomotion), it becomes temporarily stored in the hippocampus by mechanisms similar to the early phase of LTP (E-LTP). If the exploratory behavior of the rat goes unreinforced, these relatively short-lasting traces (1-3 h) gradually weaken and eventually fade-to be reupdated. On the other hand, if the explorations of the rat lead to rewards (or punishments), additional modulatory inputs to the hippocampus become activated and convert the short-term, theta-dependent memory, into long-term stores.},

  abstract = {Research in reversal learning has mainly focused on the functional role of dopamine and striatal structures in driving behavior on the basis of classic reinforcement learning mechanisms. However, recent evidence indicates that, beyond classic reinforcement learning adaptations, individuals may also learn the inherent task structure and anticipate the occurrence of reversals. A candidate structure to support such task representation is the hippocampus, which might create a flexible representation of the environment that can be adaptively applied to goal-directed behavior. To investigate the functional role of the hippocampus in the implementation of anticipatory strategies in reversal learning, we first studied, in 20 healthy individuals (11 women), whether the gray matter anatomy and volume of the hippocampus were related to anticipatory strategies in a reversal learning task. Second, we tested 20 refractory temporal lobe epileptic patients (11 women) with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, who served as a hippocampal lesion model. Our results indicate that healthy participants were able to learn the task structure and use it to guide their behavior and optimize their performance. Participants' ability to adopt anticipatory strategies correlated with the gray matter volume of the hippocampus. In contrast, hippocampal patients were unable to grasp the higher-order structure of the task with the same success than controls. Present results indicate that the hippocampus is necessary to respond in an appropriately flexible manner to high-order environments, and disruptions in this structure can render behavior habitual and inflexible.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the neural substrates involved in reversal learning has provoked a great deal of interest in the last years. Studies with nonhuman primates have shown that, through repetition, individuals are able to anticipate the occurrence of reversals and, thus, adjust their behavior accordingly. The present investigation is devoted to know the role of the hippocampus in such strategies. Importantly, our findings evidence that the hippocampus is necessary to anticipate the occurrence of reversals, and disruptions in this structure can render behavior habitual and inflexible.},

  abstract = {Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1–3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A plethora of indirect findings suggests that mood disorders may be caused by or result in structural changes in the brain, namely decreased hippocampal cell proliferation. METHODS: To test for these hypotheses, we used a rat model of depression, learned helplessness. Moderate unpredictable and inescapable foot shocks induced learned helplessness only in a portion of the rats. Rats that showed helpless behavior were compared to those behaving normally after inescapable shock. Proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus were labeled with BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine). RESULTS: Helpless behavior appeared before the decrease of dentate gyrus cell proliferation was maximal. Cell proliferation was decreased to the same extent in animals that developed helplessness as those that were not helpless. Furthermore, immobilization stress, which reduced the rate of cell proliferation, did not induce learned helplessness. CONCLUSION: These results are in line with reports that the rate of dentate gyrus cell proliferation is acutely down-regulated by stress, but the development of helpless behavior does not correlate with this process. Further studies will have to clarify if during learned helpless behavior neurogenesis is impaired by altered differentiation or survival of cells.},

Herein we further tested for the effects of MDMA (0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg x 2/day) after exposure on P11-20 on reference and working memory in the Morris water maze (MWM), on reference memory in the Barnes maze, and on cued learning in the visible platform version of the MWM. The MWM and Barnes mazes were counterbalanced such that half the litters received the MWM-first and the other half received the Barnes maze first. Effects on MWM performance as a function of test order were observed. For animals that received the Barnes maze first, spatial MWM learning and memory trends were seen but they were not significantly different between MDMA groups and saline controls. For those receiving the MWM-first, there are consistent impairments on all measures in the MDMA groups compared to controls on MWM performance (latency, path length, and cumulative distance from the goal). On probe trials, MDMA animals receiving the MWM-first showed increased distance from the target site compared to controls. There were no MDMA effects seen on cued trials in the MWM or on straight channel swimming trials regardless of test order, indicating that MDMA had no effects on swimming ability or on the skills needed to learn the MWM. Similarly, there were no effects of MDMA on MWM working memory regardless of test order. No MDMA effects on the Barnes maze were found regardless of test order, however, the interpretation of this finding was compromised by the poor performance of the animals on this task.},

Spatial learning is assessed across repeated trials and reference memory is determined by preference for the platform area when the platform is absent. Reversal and shift trials enhance the detection of spatial impairments. Trial-dependent, latent and discrimination learning can be assessed using modifications of the basic protocol. Search-to-platform area determines the degree of reliance on spatial versus non-spatial strategies. Cued trials determine whether performance factors that are unrelated to place learning are present. Escape from water is relatively immune from activity or body mass differences, making it ideal for many experimental models. The MWM has proven to be a robust and reliable test that is strongly correlated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity and NMDA receptor function. We present protocols for performing variants of the MWM test, from which results can be obtained from individual animals in as few as 6 days.},

Over the years, various methods of analysing rodent data collected during this task have been proposed. These methods span from classical performance measurements to more sophisticated categorisation techniques which classify the animal swimming path into behavioural classes known as exploration strategies. Classification techniques provide additional insight into the different types of animal behaviours but still only a limited number of studies utilise them. This is primarily because they depend highly on machine learning knowledge. We have previously demonstrated that the animals implement various strategies and that classifying entire trajectories can lead to the loss of important information. In this work, we have developed a generalised and robust classification methodology to boost classification performance and nullify the need for manual tuning. We have also made available an open-source software based on this methodology.},

  abstract = {What does research look like in practice? Aside from popular assumptions of how researchers are lonely isolated individuals sitting disconnected from the rest of the world enmeshed in thought, a considerable part of research involves working with data. Whether this data is quantitative, qualitative, gathered through experiments or involves writing code, all of this data is not just magically ‘invented’ out of thin air, but instead develops in a process of interaction with both human beings and technical systems. However only a small fragment of this process is presented to outside reviewers, the outputs and the framing often specifically designed to make a specific point. How the author got there, and which assumptions were made on the way and how these assumptions developed over time is seldom included in the final write-up. The following article argues that rather than just providing output data to be considered in research – or providing explanations for technical outcomes as is frequently proposed in computer science, accountability can only be developed by better understanding the research process. In order to do this, we suggest a series of mechanisms that can be built into existing research practices to make them more intelligible to outside reviewers and scholars. These mechanisms are designed to develop the accountability principle of the GDPR and ensure more accountable scientific research. As the GDPR recitals also explicitly references scientific research, an accountability by design approach to technology research is grounded both in the articles and recitals of the GDPR. By documenting the key elements of a narrative research story which explains not just what you believe to have discovered but also how researchers got there, it may also be possible to create better accountability mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The elevated plus maze is a widely used behavioral assay for rodents and it has been validated to assess the anti-anxiety effects of pharmacological agents and steroid hormones, and to define brain regions and mechanisms underlying anxiety-related behavior. Briefly, rats or mice are placed at the junction of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm, and entries/duration in each arm are recorded by a video-tracking system and observer simultaneously for 5 min. Other ethological parameters (i.e., rears, head dips and stretched-attend postures) can also be observed. An increase in open arm activity (duration and/or entries) reflects anti-anxiety behavior. In our laboratory, rats or mice are exposed to the plus maze on one occasion; thus, results can be obtained in 5 min per rodent.},

  abstract = {The raphe nuclei are positioned midline in the brainstem throughout the midbrain, pons, and medulla. These nuclei contain primarily serotonergic neurons, which release serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) with autocrine and paracrine effects, as well as synaptic connections. Serotonin generation comes from L-tryptophan via a two-step process catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase and L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. Upon release, serotonin binds a 5-HT receptor postsynaptically, subtypes of which exert different physiologic effects. Presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors modulate the subsequent release of serotonin. The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) is responsible for presynaptic reuptake. Serotonin primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase.~ The more rostral nuclei located in the midbrain and rostral pons – caudal linear nucleus, dorsal raphe, and median raphe – have projections which extend to forebrain structures. These projections modulate behavioral and emotional functioning, including mood regulation, memory, and sleep-wake cycle. The caudal nuclei of the caudal pons and medulla– raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, and raphe pallidus – primarily project to spinal cord structures; this occurs via parallel projections to ventral, intermediate, and dorsal columns. They modulate nociception and movement. A decrease of serotonergic input to the limbic system has been the longstanding and primary model for the pathogenesis of major depression. Decreased synthesis of serotonin, low-affinity binding to post-synaptic receptors, increased the response of presynaptic autoreceptors, and rapid degradation of serotonin all carry links to clinical depression. These differences in physiology are often due to genetic polymorphisms, explaining increased susceptibility in patients with a family history of depression. While the pathogenesis of depression is understood to be multifactorial in most patients, augmentation of serotonergic transmission with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been the longstanding first-line treatment for depression.},

We evaluated the effects of post-training anesthetic doses of ketamine to selectively manipulate memory consolidation, and the effect of pre-retention sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine on memory retrieval in passive avoidance and T-maze tasks in mice. Repeated post-training anesthetic doses of ketamine impaired the consolidation of memory in the T-maze but not in passive avoidance paradigms. This impairment was not permanent but diminished 1-2 days after ketamine withdrawal. Sub-anesthetic post-training doses of ketamine (5 mg/kg) had no effect on memory consolidation, and larger doses (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg) did not influence the retrieval of memory in the T-maze. The data suggest that repeated anesthetic doses of ketamine block NMDA receptors and affect memory consolidation. Moreover, NMDA mechanisms antagonized by ketamine appear to be selectively involved in spatial (T-maze) memory mechanisms but may not be necessary for non-spatial (passive avoidance) memory consolidation. © 2006 IBRO.},

  abstract = {Major depression disorder (MDD) is a debilitating mental illness with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the growing number of studies that have emerged, the precise underlying mechanisms of MDD remain unknown. When studying MDD, tissue samples like peripheral blood or post-mortem brain samples are used to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Unfortunately, there are many uncontrollable factors with such samples such as medication history, age, time after death before post-mortem tissue was collected, age, sex, race, and living conditions. Although these factors are critical, they introduce confounding variables that can influence the outcome profoundly. In this regard, animal models provide a crucial approach to examine neural circuitry and molecular and cellular pathways in a controlled environment. Further, manipulations with pharmacological agents and gene editing are accepted methods of studying depression in animal models, which is impossible to employ in human patient studies. Here, we have reviewed the most widely used animal models of depression and delineated the salient features of each model in terms of behavioral and neurobiological outcomes. We have also illustrated the current challenges in using these models and have suggested strategies to delineate the underlying mechanism associated with vulnerability or resilience to developing depression.},

  abstract = {Depression is a common psychiatric disorder that can occur throughout an individual's lifespan. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) protocol is currently the most commonly used to develop an animal model of depression. Due to the variable duration and procedure of CUMS, it is difficult to reproduce and explore the mechanism of CUMS-induced depression effectively. In the present study, the CUMS-induced behavioral phenotypes were assessed in male C57BL/6J mice at the age of 9–18 weeks. The mice stressed for 3–8 weeks exhibited lower body weight as well as longer immobility time of forced swim and tail suspension test compared to control mice. Moreover, lessening and impairment of hippocampal neurons was found in stressed mice at the age of 18 weeks, which was correlated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines BDNF, Htr1a, and IL-6 in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, no difference between stressed and control mice was observed neither in the sucrose preference nor in the open field test (except for vertical activity in OFT) at the age of 18 weeks. These findings reveal that 3–8 weeks of chronic stress could induce depression-like alterations in male C57BL/6J mice and the behavioral adaptation of aged mice might fail to the availability of the depression model.},

Emerging evidence has suggested that the 5-HT2BR is implicated in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, fibrosis disorders, cancer, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the nervous system. Eight crystal complex structures of the 5-HT2BR bound with different ligands provided great insights into ligand recognition, activation mechanism, and biased signaling. Numerous 5-HT2BR antagonists have been discovered and developed, and several of them have advanced to clinical trials.

Microglia are the predominant resident immune cells in the brain and exhibit a critical role in depression. Recent studies have suggested that depression can be regarded as a microglial disease. Microglia regulate inflammation, synaptic plasticity, and the formation of neural networks, all of which affect depression. In this review, we highlighted the role of microglia in the pathology of depression. First, we described microglial activation in animal models and clinically depressed patients. Second, we emphasized the possible mechanisms by which microglia recognize depression-associated stress and regulate conditions. Third, we described how antidepressants (clinical medicines and natural products) affect microglial activation. Thus, this review aimed to objectively analyze the role of microglia in depression and focus on potential antidepressants. These data suggested that regulation of microglial actions might be a novel therapeutic strategy to counteract the adverse effects of devastating mental disorders.},

The hippocampus might play a crucial role in the interplay between sleep disturbance and depressive symptomatology, e.g., hippocampal atrophy is typically seen in both insomnia disorder and depression. Thus, examining the role of hippocampal volume in the interplay between poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in large healthy populations is vital. METHODS: We investigated the association between self-reported sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and hippocampal total and subfields' volumes in 1603 healthy young adults from the Behavioral Brain Research Project.~Mediation analysis explored the mediating role of hippocampal volumes between sleep quality and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Self-reported sleep quality and depressive symptoms were positively correlated. In addition, it negatively related to three hippocampal subfields but not total hippocampal volume. In particular, hippocampal subfield DG and CA4 volumes mediated the interrelationship between poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings improved the current understanding of the relationship between sleep disturbance, depressive symptomatology, and hippocampal subfields in healthy populations. Considering the crucial role of DG in hippocampal neurogenesis, our results suggest that poor sleep quality may contribute to depression through a reduction of DG volume leading to impaired neurogenesis which is crucial for the regulation of mood.},

Despite this loud and persistent recommendation, scientists continue to use rainbow colormaps. Have we failed to communicate our message, or do rainbow colormaps offer advantages that have not been fully appreciated? We argue that rainbow colormaps have properties that are underappreciated by existing design conventions.

One link between the DR-5-HT system and affective disorders is exposure to stressors. Stress is a major risk factor for affective disorders, and stressors alter activity of DR neurons in an anatomically specific manner. Stress-induced changes in DR neuronal activity are transmitted to targets of the DR via ascending serotonergic projections, many of which collateralize to innervate multiple brain regions. Indeed, the collateralization of DR efferents allows for the coordination of diverse components of the stress response. This review will summarize our current understanding of the organization of the ascending DR system and its collateral projections. Using the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system as an example of a stress-related initiator of DR activity, we will discuss how topographic specificity of afferent regulation of ascending DR circuits serves to coordinate activity in functionally diverse target regions under appropriate conditions.},

  abstract = {Many mammalian species, including humans, exhibit social behavior and form complex social groups. Mechanistic studies in animal models have revealed important roles for the endocannabinoid signaling system, comprising G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid-derived agonists, in the control of neural processes that underpin social anxiety and social reward, two key aspects of social behavior. An emergent insight from these studies is that endocannabinoid signaling in specific circuits of the brain is context dependent and selectively recruited. These insights open new vistas on the neural basis of social behavior and social impairment.},

  abstract = {Chronic psychological stress is associated with an increased risk for relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and impedes the treatment of this condition. However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal barrier. This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal barrier integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal barrier defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.},

(               R,S               )-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (               R               )-ketamine (arketamine) and (               S               )-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson \& Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (               R,S               )-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (               R,S               )-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (               R,S               )-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain–gut–microbiota axis and brain–spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson’s disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.},

This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

They are integrated into the existing neuronal circuits according to several factors such as age, physical exercise and hormonal status. At present, the role of these new neurons is debated. Computational simulations of hippocampal function allow the effects of neurogenesis to be explored, at least from a computational perspective. The present work implements a model of neurogenesis in the hippocampus with artificial neural networks, based on a standard theoretical model of biologically plausible hippocampal circuits. The performance of the model in retrieval of a variable number of patterns or memories was evaluated (episodic memory evaluation). The model increased, in a phase subsequent to initial learning, the number of granular cells by 30\% relative to their initial number. In contrast to a model without neurogenesis, the retrieval of recent memories was very significantly improved, although remote memories were only slightly affected by neurogenesis. This increase in the quality of retrieval of new memories represents a clear advantage that we attribute to the neurogenesis process. This advantage becomes more significant for higher storage loads. The model presented here suggests an important functional role of neurogenesis on learning and memory.},

  abstract = {In contrast to models and theories that relate adult neurogenesis with the processes of learning and memory, almost no solid hypotheses have been formulated that involve a possible neurocomputational influence of adult neurogenesis on forgetting. Based on data from a previous study that implemented a simple but complete model of the main hippocampal circuitry (Weisz \& Argibay, 2009), we now test this model under different situations to better study the case of remote memories. The results of this work show that following neurogenesis, the new, ongoing memories in the hippocampus are better retained than when no neurogenesis occurs at all, while the older memories are affected (to a lesser extent) by a special type of interference that is different from interference that occurs with an increasing number of memories per se. This work adds a new point of analysis in support of the interference view that might lead to the forgetting of memories in the hippocampus as they are transferred to neocortex for long-term storage, consistent with the Complementary Learning Systems models of system-level consolidation. Attention should be directed to the specific causes of interference; the results of this work signal a type of distortion of remote memories that is produced by the birth and the growth of new processing units, which results in a subtly impoverished retrieval as new neurons become active. The proposals of this model fit well with some empirical findings that are related to the issue. In the future, as new evidence emerges, we believe that this biological process, which is largely related to learning and memory, will also help to shape our ideas about normal forgetting and its possible contributions to system consolidation.},

However, the background strain of the mouse model used can have a substantial effect on the observed behavioral phenotype, with some strains exhibiting superior learning ability relative to others. To ensure differences between transgene negative and transgene positive mice can be detected, identification of a training procedure sensitive to the background strain is essential. Failure to tailor the MWM protocol to the background strain of the mouse model may lead to under- or over- training, thereby masking group differences in probe trials. Here, a MWM protocol tailored for use with the F1 FVB/N × 129S6 background is described. This is a frequently used background strain to study the age-dependent effects of mutant P301L tau (rTg(TauP301L)4510 mice) on the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease.

The sense of agency is a byproduct of human movements and also greatly shapes perception and behaviour. Furthermore, research on human–machine interaction has highlighted the importance of the sense of agency in joint control between humans and automated systems. In this Review, we first provide an overview of how the sense of agency influences human perception and how the perceptual effects of the sense of agency are used to measure this subjective feeling. Second, we review how the sense of agency modulates behaviour, including action selection, goal-directed actions, and social cognition. Third, we introduce theoretical and neural accounts of how the sense of agency arises. Finally, we explain how the sense of agency applies to human–machine interactions, an area that is rapidly developing and increasingly linked to daily life.},

Higher doses were required to impair retrieval of overtrained place navigation. In a working memory version of the task, retrieval latencies were shorter than acquisition latencies with 4- to 15-min but not with 30- and 60-min delays. Latent learning was only effective with the 4-min delay. Ketamine prolonged the initial search of the hidden platform at 3 mg/kg and impaired latent learning but not active acquisition at 1.5-10 mg/kg. Comparison of behavioral and synaptic effects of ketamine suggests that long-term potentiation is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition, for acquisition of place navigation, because search strategy and latent place learning are impaired by ketamine doses not interfering with this synaptic phenomenon.},

These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here, I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and deduplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects.},

Atropine-treated rats were impaired on a place response of swimming to a platform hidden in a pool filled with opaque water. With extended training, they did learn the place response, though not with control precision, as shown by better than chance heading angles upon swim initiation, searches in the old location for a platform that had been moved, and by correct swims from novel starting locations. Acquisition could not be accounted for by habituation to the drug. In contrast with the acquisition deficit, pretrained rats were relatively unimpaired by the drug. In separate experiments, the strategies used by the drugged animals were examined. Atropine-treated rats were not impaired in acquisition or retention of a cue task, swimming to a visible platform, or a position response task, turning left to locate a platform, but both control and atropine-treated rats were unable to reverse position responses. Possibly, atropine-treated rats can use cue and position response strategies in part or in combination to acquire a place response. Atropine-treated rats were unable to acquire a place learning set, which involved swimming to a new location each day, a response that is eventually performed by normal rats in approximately one trial. They also were unable to perform a learning-set response, which they had acquired when undrugged. Insofar as the impairments following atropine are characteristic of a deficit in the use of a locale strategy, that is, making rapid use of relational properties of distal cues, whereas their successes are characteristic of the use of taxon strategies, that is, cue or position responses, the results suggest that locale systems of navigation are more importantly dependent on cholinergic brain mechanisms than taxon strategies. The resistance of preacquired place responses to atropine may suggest that normally rats acquire place responses by using a locale strategy but effect rehearsed responses by using taxon strategies. Finally, characteristic differences in acquisition, retention, and reversal of atropine-treated and control rats using different navigational strategies suggest new possibilities for interpreting various performance features displayed by animals after other types of treatment.},

Because the solution to any spatial learning problem consists of acquiring at least two primary elements of a task, task procedures and spatial learning, the study, in addition to assessing spatial ability on a place task, used two training/testing methods to identify the nature of the spatial impairment associated with visual cortex lesions. Non-spatial training consisted of learning to find a platform in the dark and spatial training consisted of a series of matching-to-place problems. The results confirmed that although rats with visual cortex lesions were impaired on place learning, the deficit was partially ameliorated by non-spatial training given following the lesion, and completely ameliorated by non-spatial training given before the lesion. Nevertheless, all visual cortex groups failed to show a quadrant preference on a probe trial and displayed a profound impairment in matching-to-place learning. This definitive demonstration that appropriate testing methods can reveal a failure in spatial behavior following visual cortex lesions is consistent with the idea that primary visual cortex is required in spatial navigation.},

In the visual cortex, the selectivity of neurons for oriented stimuli at the time of eye opening is poor1,2,3,4,5 and increases dramatically after the onset of visual experience3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we investigate whether visual experience has a significant role in the maturation of orientation selectivity and underlying cortical circuits9,10,11,12 using two forms of deprivation: dark rearing, which completely eliminates experience, and binocular lid suture, which alters the pattern of sensory driven activity13. Orientation maps were present in dark-reared ferrets, but fully mature levels of tuning were never attained. In contrast, only rudimentary levels of orientation selectivity were observed in lid-sutured ferrets. Despite these differences, horizontal connections in both groups were less extensive and less clustered than normal, suggesting that long-range cortical processing is not essential for the expression of orientation selectivity, but may be needed for the full maturation of tuning. Thus, experience is beneficial or highly detrimental to cortical maturation, depending on the pattern of sensory driven activity.},

  abstract = {There has been a recent and substantial increase in the use of open-source tools for conducting research studies in neuroscience. The OpenBehavior Project was created to disseminate open-source projects specific to the study of behavior. In this commentary, we emphasize the benefits of adopting an open-source mindset and highlight current methods and projects that give promise for open-source tools to drive advancement of behavioral measurement and ultimately understanding the neural basis of behavior. Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in the use of new neurobiological tools for measuring and controlling brain cell activity. Recent developments in optogenetics, chemogenetics, cellular imaging, and fiber photometry have spiked publications across cellular, systems, and behavioral neuroscience. Researchers with expertise in molecular biology or cellular physiology are now carrying out behavioral studies, and often bring a fresh approach to the fine-grained study of behavior that has led to the development of many new assays for measuring behavior and cognition in animal models (mice, flies, worms, etc.). Thanks to a revolution in low-cost methods for 3D printing and off-the-shelf microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Teensy, microPython) and single-board computers (Raspberry Pi), many of these research groups are able to create complex behavioral tasks quite easily. The R and Python languages, specialized computing libraries (e.g., numpy, OpenCV, TensorFlow), and the Anaconda Python distribution have been crucial for the development of open source analysis software for neuroscience projects. In parallel, these developments in neuroscience research have occurred during a time when there is a simultaneous movement toward sharing computer code (Eglen et al., 2017; Gleeson et al., 2017), through websites like GitHub, and opening up the process of software and hardware design to non-experts through hackerspaces and makerspaces. Despite these developments, there is still room for …},

  abstract = {A classic and influential work that laid the theoretical foundations for information theory and a timely text for contemporary informations theorists and practitioners.             With the influential book Cybernetics, first published in 1948, Norbert Wiener laid the theoretical foundations for the multidisciplinary field of cybernetics, the study of controlling the flow of information in systems with feedback loops, be they biological, mechanical, cognitive, or social. At the core of Wiener's theory is the message (information), sent and responded to (feedback); the functionality of a machine, organism, or society depends on the quality of messages. Information corrupted by noise prevents homeostasis, or equilibrium. And yet Cybernetics is as philosophical as it is technical, with the first chapter devoted to Newtonian and Bergsonian time and the philosophical mixed with the technical throughout. This book brings the 1961 second edition back into print, with new forewords by Doug Hill and Sanjoy Mitter.             Contemporary readers of Cybernetics will marvel at Wiener's prescience—his warnings against “noise,” his disdain for “hucksters” and “gadget worshipers,” and his view of the mass media as the single greatest anti-homeostatic force in society. This edition of Cybernetics gives a new generation access to a classic text.},

The pathophysiology of this common and chronic disease is still not completely understood. The gut microbiome is an increasingly recognized environmental factor that can have a role in depression, acting through the gut–microbiota–brain axis. The available treatment for depression is still insufficient since 30\% of patients are treatment-resistant. There is an unquestionable need for novel strategies. Ketamine is an effective antidepressant in treatment-resistant patients. It is suggested that the antidepressant effect of ketamine may be partially mediated by the modification of gut microbiota. In this study, we presented a review of data on gut microbiota in depression with special attention to the effect of ketamine on the microbiome in animal models of depression. Earlier reports are preliminary and are still insufficient to draw firm conclusion, but further studies in this field might help to understand the role of the gut–brain axis in the treatment of depression and might be the ground for developing new effective treatment strategies.},

In the CMS model, rats or mice are exposed sequentially, over a period of weeks, to a variety of mild stressors, and the measure most commonly used to track the effects is a decrease in consumption of a palatable sweet solution. The model has good predictive validity (behavioural changes are reversed by chronic treatment with a wide variety of antidepressants), face validity (almost all demonstrable symptoms of depression have been demonstrated), and construct validity (CMS causes a generalized decrease in responsiveness to rewards, comparable to anhedonia, the core symptom of the melancholic subtype of major depressive disorder). Overall, the CMS procedure appears to be at least as valid as any other animal model of depression. The procedure does, however, have two major drawbacks. One is the practical difficulty of carrying out CMS experiments, which are labour intensive, demanding of space, and of long duration. The other is that, while the procedure operates reliably in many laboratories, it can be difficult to establish, for reasons which remain unclear. However, once established, the CMS model can be used to study problems that are extremely difficult to address by other means.},

This paper provides an update on the validity and reliability of the CMS model, and reviews recent data on the neurobiological basis of CMS effects and the mechanisms of antidepressant action: the volume of this research may be unique in providing a comprehensive account of antidepressant action within a single model. Also discussed is the use of CMS in drug discovery, with particular reference to hippocampal and extra-hippocampal targets. The high translational potential of the CMS model means that the neurobiological mechanisms described may be of particular relevance to human depression and mechanisms of clinical antidepressant action.},

The aims of this study were to establish the extent to which the procedure is reproducible, and to identify experimental variables relevant to its reliability. Because failures to replicate frequently remain unpublished, a survey methodology was used. A questionnaire was circulated to 170 labs identified from a PubMed search as having published a CMS study in the years 2010 or 2015 (with no selection in respect of the results reported). Responses were returned by 71 (42\%) of the recipients, followed by further correspondence with some of them. Most of the respondents (n~=~53: 75\%) reported that the CMS procedure worked reliably in their hands. Of the others, 15 (21\%) reported that the procedure was usually reliable, but not always (n~=~9: 13\%) or not for all measures (n~=~6: 8\%). Only three respondents (4\%) reported being unable to reproduce the characteristic effects, two of whom may be using an insufficient duration of CMS exposure. A series of analyses compared the 75\% of ‘reliable’ labs with the 25\% of ‘less reliable’ labs on a range of experimenter, subject, stress and outcome variables. Few if any significant differences between these two samples were identified, possibly because of the small size and diversity of the ‘less reliable’ sample. Two other limitations of the study include the (unavoidable) omission of labs that may have worked with the model but not published their data, and the use of ad hoc measures to compare the severity of different stress regimes. The results are discussed in relation to relevant published observations. It is concluded that CMS is in fact a rather robust model, but the factors that result in a less effective implementation in a minority of laboratories remain to be firmly established.},

Despite this impending success, Marr later apparently grew dissatisfied with this style of modelling, but he went on to make seminal suggestions that continue to resonate loudly throughout the field of theoretical neuroscience.

In young adult rats, recent studies on the firing properties of hippocampal neurons have emphasized the importance of the CA3 subregion in the rapid encoding of new spatial information. Here, we compared the spatial firing patterns of CA1 and CA3 neurons in aged memory-impaired rats with those of young rats as they explored familiar and novel environments. We found that CA1 place cells in aged and young rats had similar firing characteristics in the familiar and novel environments. In contrast, aged CA3 place cells had higher firing rates in general and failed to change their firing rates and place fields as much as CA3 cells of young rats when the rats were introduced to a novel environment. Thus, aged CA3 cells failed to rapidly encode new spatial information compared with young CA3 cells. These data suggest an important and selective contribution of CA3 dysfunction to age-related memory impairment.},

  abstract = {Historically, the hippocampus has been viewed as a temporary memory structure. Consistent with the central premise of standard consolidation theory (SCT), a memory is initially hippocampus-dependent but, over time, it undergoes a consolidation process and eventually becoming represented in a distributed cortical network independent of the hippocampus. In this paper, we review evidence that is incompatible with each of the following essential features of SCT that are derived from its central premise: (1) Hippocampal damage reliably produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia, (2) all declarative explicit memories are equivalent with respect to consolidation, (3) consolidation entails a process of duplication in which a particular cortically based memory is identical to the hippocampus-dependent memory from which it derived, (4) consolidated memories are permanent and immutable. We propose an alternative hypothesis that assumes a transformation process and changes in the memory over time. Building on multiple trace theory (Nadel \& Moscovitch, 1997), the transformation hypothesis contains three key elements that differentiate it from SCT: (1) An initially formed memory, which is assumed to be episodic and context-bound, remains dependent on the hippocampus for as long as it is available, (2) with time and experience, a hippocampal memory supports the development, in neocortex, of a less integrated, schematic version, which retains the gist of the original memory, but few of its contextual details, (3) there is a dynamic interplay between the two types of memory such that one or another may be dominant, depending on the circumstances at retrieval. Evidence is provided in support of the transformation hypothesis, which is advanced as a framework for unifying the seemingly disparate results of studies of anterograde and retrograde memory in the animal and human literatures.},

Consistent with the central premise of standard consolidation theory (SCT), a memory is initially hippocampus-dependent but, over time, it undergoes a consolidation process and eventually becoming represented in a distributed cortical network independent of the hippocampus. In this paper, we review evidence that is incompatible with each of the following essential features of SCT that are derived from its central premise: (1) Hippocampal damage reliably produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia, (2) all declarative explicit memories are equivalent with respect to consolidation, (3) consolidation entails a process of duplication in which a particular cortically based memory is identical to the hippocampus-dependent memory from which it derived, (4) consolidated memories are permanent and immutable. We propose an alternative hypothesis that assumes a transformation process and changes in the memory over time. Building on multiple trace theory (Nadel \& Moscovitch, 1997), the transformation hypothesis contains three key elements that differentiate it from SCT: (1) An initially formed memory, which is assumed to be episodic and context-bound, remains dependent on the hippocampus for as long as it is available, (2) with time and experience, a hippocampal memory supports the development, in neocortex, of a less integrated, schematic version, which retains the gist of the original memory, but few of its contextual details, (3) there is a dynamic interplay between the two types of memory such that one or another may be dominant, depending on the circumstances at retrieval. Evidence is provided in support of the transformation hypothesis, which is advanced as a framework for unifying the seemingly disparate results of studies of anterograde and retrograde memory in the animal and human literatures.},

  abstract = {The expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is altered by neuronal activity and promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro. To study the effects of L1 on learning and synaptic plasticity, transgenic mice have been created which express L1 ectopically in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressing astrocytes. Ninety mice, including GFAP-L1-transgenic mice from two genetic backgrounds and their littermates, were tested for swimming navigation learning in the Morris water maze according to a standardized protocol. While learning the position of an invisible target platform and also relearning its position after relocation, GFAP-L1-transgenic mice spent a greater fraction of their swim time in the target quadrant. Moreover, they showed a more rapid improvement of escape performance during the first day of training. Factor analysis revealed that this difference in swimming pattern could not be explained by non-cognitive factors. Factor analysis also revealed that, during a probe trial, the GFAP-L1-transgenic mice spent comparatively less time in the old target quadrant than predicted by the increased searching they had shown during acquisition learning. Hence, ectopic expression of L1 by astrocytes in mice appears to be linked to a factor which increases behavioural flexibility and selectivity while learning and relearning, but concomitantly may lead to a relative reduction of spatial retention.},

The anatomical and physiological characteristics of the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system position it to contribute to stress-induced cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on cardiovascular dysfunction produced by social stress and a major theme highlighted is that differences in coping strategy determine individual differences in social stress-induced cardiovascular vulnerability. The establishment of different coping strategies and cardiovascular vulnerability during repeated social stress has recently been shown to parallel a unique plasticity in LC afferent regulation, resulting in either excitatory or inhibitory input to the LC. This contrasting regulation of the LC would translate to differences in cardiovascular regulation and may serve as the basis for individual differences in the cardiopathological consequences of social stress. The advances described suggest new directions for developing treatments and/or strategies for decreasing stress-induced cardiovascular vulnerability.},

Controlling for relevant confounders can debias the estimated causal effect of a predictor on an outcome; that is, it can bring the estimated regression coefficient closer to the value of the true causal effect. But statistical control works only under ideal circumstances. When the selected control variables are inappropriate, controlling can result in estimates that are more biased than uncontrolled estimates. Despite the ubiquity of statistical control in published regression analyses and the consequences of controlling for inappropriate third variables, the selection of control variables is rarely explicitly justified in print. We argue that to carefully select appropriate control variables, researchers must propose and defend a causal structure that includes the outcome, predictors, and plausible confounders. We underscore the importance of causality when selecting control variables by demonstrating how regression coefficients are affected by controlling for appropriate and inappropriate variables. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for applied researchers who wish to use statistical control.},

  abstract = {Running exercise has been shown to relieve symptoms of depression, but the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects are unclear. Microglia and concomitant dysregulated neuroinflammation play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of depression. However, the effects of running exercise on hippocampal neuroinflammation and the number and activation of microglia in depression have not been studied. In this study, rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 5 weeks followed by treadmill running for 6 weeks. The depressive-like symptoms of the rats were assessed with a sucrose preference test (SPT). Immunohistochemistry and stereology were performed to quantify the total number of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)+ microglia, and immunofluorescence was used to quantify the density of Iba1+/cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ in subregions of the hippocampus. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that running exercise reversed the decreased sucrose preference of rats with CUS-induced depression. In addition, CUS increased the number of hippocampal microglia and microglial activation in rats, but running exercise attenuated the CUS-induced increases in the number of microglia in the hippocampus and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Furthermore, CUS significantly increased the hippocampal levels of inflammatory factors, and the increases in inflammatory factors in the hippocampus were suppressed by running exercise. These results suggest that the antidepressant effects of exercise may be mediated by reducing the number of microglia and inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Gastrodin, which is extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Gastrodia elata Blume, can ameliorate neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. However, it's  possible underlying mechanisms remain still elusive. PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling  pathway is involved in the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) after  cerebral ischemia. In this study, we investigated whether the beneficial effect  of gastrodin on hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia is correlated  with the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Bilateral common carotid artery  occlusion (BCCAO) in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in  primary cultured hippocampal NSCs were used to mimic brain ischemic injury. The  Morris water maze (MWM) test was executed to detect spatial learning and memory.  Proliferation, differentiation, and mature neurons were examined using  immunofluorescence. The survival and proliferation of NSCs were assessed by CCK-8  assay and BrdU immunofluorescence staining, respectively. ELISA and western blot  were used to detect the level of the PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. In BCCAO  mice, administering gastrodin (50 and 100~mg/kg) for 14~d restored cognitive  behaviors; meanwhile, neurogenesis in hippocampus was stimulated, and PDE9 was  inhibited and cGMP-PKG was activated by gastrodin. Consistent with the results,  administering gastrodin (from 0.01-1~μmol/L) for 48~h dose-dependently  ameliorated the cell viability and promoted greatly the proliferation in primary  hippocampal NSCs exposed to OGD/R. Gastrodin further decreased PDE9 activity and  up-regulated cGMP-PKG level. KT5823, a PKG inhibitor, markedly abrogated the  protective effects of gastrodin on OGD/R-injured NSCs, accompanied by the  down-regulation of PKG protein expression, but had no effects on PDE9 activity  and cGMP level. Gastrodin could accelerate hippocampal neurogenesis after  cerebral ischemia, which is mediated, at least partly, by PDE9-cGMP-PKG signaling  pathway.},

However, the relevance of the stress experience-dependent long-term depression (SLTD) to spatial memory task is unknown. Here we have investigated the effects of acute and sub-acute elevated platform (EP) and foot shock (FS) stress on LTD induction in CA1 region of the hippocampus of anesthetized rats and spatial memory in Morris water maze. We found that LTD was facilitated by acute EP stress, but not by sub-acute EP stress that may be due to the fast adaptation of the animals to this naturalistic mild stress. However, FS stress, an inadaptable strong stress, facilitated LTD induction both in acute and sub-acute treatment. In addition, with the same stress protocols, acute EP stress impaired spatial memory but the sub-acute EP stressed animals performed the spatial memory task as well as the controls, may due to the same reason of adaptation. However, acute FS stress slightly impaired learning but sub-acute FS even enhanced memory retrieval. Our results showed that SLTD was disassociated with the effect of stress on memory task but might be related to stress experience-dependent form of aberrant memory. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

  abstract = {Traumatic brain injury is an important global public health problem. Traumatic brain injury not only causes neural cell death, but also induces dendritic spine degeneration. Spared neurons from cell death in the injured brain may exhibit dendrite damage, dendritic spine degeneration, mature spine loss, synapse loss, and impairment of activity. Dendritic degeneration and synapse loss may significantly contribute to functional impairments and neurological disorders following traumatic brain injury. Normal function of the nervous system depends on maintenance of the functionally intact synaptic connections between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spines from neurons and their target cells. During synaptic plasticity, the numbers and shapes of dendritic spines undergo dynamic reorganization. Enlargement of spine heads and the formation and stabilization of new spines are associated with long-term potentiation, while spine shrinkage and retraction are associated with long-term depression. Consolidation of memory is associated with remodeling and growth of preexisting synapses and the formation of new synapses. To date, there is no effective treatment to prevent dendritic degeneration and synapse loss. This review outlines the current data related to treatments targeting dendritic spines that propose to enhance spine remodeling and improve functional recovery after traumatic brain injury. The mechanisms underlying proposed beneficial effects of therapy targeting dendritic spines remain elusive, possibly including blocking activation of Cofilin induced by beta amyloid, Ras activation, and inhibition of GSK-3 signaling pathway. Further understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic degeneration/loss following traumatic brain injury will advance the understanding of the pathophysiology induced by traumatic brain injury and may lead to the development of novel treatments for traumatic brain injury.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that the imbalance between oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system may be associated with the development neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Major depression and anxiety are presently correlated with a lowered total antioxidant state and by an activated oxidative stress (OS) pathway. The classical antidepressants may produce therapeutic effects other than regulation of monoamines by increasing the antioxidant levels and normalizing the damage caused by OS processes. This chapter provides an overview of recent work on oxidative stress markers in the animal models of depression and anxiety, as well as patients with the aforementioned mood disorders. It is well documented that antioxidants can remove the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) through scavenging radicals and suppressing the OS pathway, which further protect against neuronal damage caused oxidative or nitrosative stress sources in the brain, hopefully resulting in remission of depression or anxiety symptoms. The functional understanding of the relationship between oxidative stress and depression and anxiety may pave the way for discovery of novel targets for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Memory formation involves binding of contextual features into a unitary representation1-4, whereas memory recall can occur using partial combinations of these contextual features. The neural basis underlying the relationship between a contextual memory and its constituent features is not well understood; in particular, where features are represented in the brain and how they drive recall. Here, to gain insight into this question, we developed a behavioural task in which mice use features to recall an associated contextual memory. We performed longitudinal imaging in hippocampus as mice performed this task and identified robust representations of global context but not of individual features. To identify putative brain regions that provide feature inputs to hippocampus, we inhibited cortical afferents while imaging hippocampus during behaviour. We found that whereas inhibition of entorhinal cortex led to broad silencing of hippocampus, inhibition of prefrontal anterior cingulate led to a highly specific silencing of context neurons and deficits in feature-based recall. We next developed a preparation for simultaneous imaging of anterior cingulate and hippocampus during behaviour, which revealed robust population-level representation of features in anterior cingulate, that lag hippocampus context representations during training but dynamically reorganize to lead and target recruitment of context ensembles in hippocampus during recall. Together, we provide the first mechanistic insights into where contextual features are represented in the brain, how they emerge, and how they access long-range episodic representations to drive memory recall.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that ketamine, an open channel blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), is effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the potential link between antidepressant-like effects of a single ketamine administration and dorsoventral differentiation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that elevation in the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells by ketamine was seen in the ventral (related to emotion), but not dorsal (related to spatial memory), hippocampus in adult mice, although the densities of neural stem cells were not affected by ketamine in both the dorsal and ventral regions. Promotion of maturation of newborn granule cells by ketamine was evident in the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus. Behavioral analyses showed that ketamine did not affect spatial memory but ameliorated depression-related behavior. Western blot analyses showed that the basal expression of the GluN2B, but not GluN1, subunit of the NMDAR was higher in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. The induction of expression of GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), by ketamine was greater in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that a single ketamine administration promotes adult neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus quite selectively. Furthermore, ventral-dominant induction of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, p-mTOR, GluA1 subunit of AMPAR, and BDNF, in the hippocampus may underlie the unique antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.},

  abstract = {Cannabinoids (CBs) are psychoactive compounds, with reported anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neoplastic properties. The study was aimed at assessing the hepatoprotective effects of CB against ethanol (EtOH)-induced liver toxicity in rats. The animals were divided into seven groups: control (Group I) and Group II were treated with 50\% ethanol (EtOH 5 mg/kg). Groups III, IV, and VI were treated with (EtOH + CB 10 mg/kg), (EtOH + CB 20 mg/kg), and (EtOH + CB 30 mg/kg), respectively. Groups V and VII consisted of animals treated with 20 and 30 mg/kg, of CB, respectively. Biochemical analysis revealed that Group IV (EtOH + CB 20 mg/kg) had reduced levels of ALT—alanine transferase, AST—aspartate aminotransferase, ALP—alanine peroxidase, MDA—malondialdehyde and increased levels of GSH-reduced glutathione. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney tissues showed that EtOH + CB (20 and 30 mg/kg) treated animal groups exhibited normal tissue architecture similar to that of the control group. ELISA revealed that the inflammatory markers were reduced in the animal groups that were treated with EtOH + CB 20 mg/kg, in comparison to the animals treated only with EtOH. The mRNA expression levels of COX-2, CD-14, and MIP-2 showed a remarkable decrease in EtOH + CB treated animal groups to control groups. Western blot analysis revealed that CB downregulated p38/JNK/ERK thereby exhibiting its hepatoprotective property by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Thus, our findings suggest that CB is a potential candidate for the treatment of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity.},

We compared population-level Ca2+ transients as wild-type mice (with intact learning-induced spine plasticity and memory) and amnestic mice (TgCRND8 mice with high levels of amyloid-β and deficits in learning-induced spine plasticity and memory) were tested for memory. Using machine-learning classifiers with different capacities to use input data with complex interactions, our findings indicate complex neuronal interactions in the memory representation of wild-type, but not amnestic, mice. Moreover, a peptide that partially restored learning-induced spine plasticity also restored the statistical complexity of the memory representation and memory behavior in Tg mice. These findings provide a previously missing bridge between levels of analysis in memory research, linking receptors, spines, higher-order neuronal dynamics and behavior.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of depression, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. (R)-ketamine has a greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine. Here, we investigated whether the gut microbiota plays a role in the antidepressant effects of these two ketamine enantiomers. The role of the gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine enantiomers in a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression was examined using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. At the phylum level, CSDS-susceptible mice showed alterations in the levels of Tenericutes and Actinobacteria; however, neither ketamine enantiomers influenced these alterations. At the class level, both ketamine enantiomers significantly attenuated the increase in the levels of Deltaproteobacteria in the susceptible mice after CSDS. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, significantly attenuated the reduction in the levels of Mollicutes in the susceptible mice. At the genus level, both ketamine enantiomers significantly attenuated the decrease in the levels of Butyricimonas in the susceptible mice. Notably, (R)-ketamine was more potent than (S)-ketamine at reducing the levels of Butyricimonas in the susceptible mice. In conclusion, this study suggests that the antidepressant effects of two enantiomers of ketamine in CSDS model may be partly mediated by the restoration of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the specific effect of (R)-ketamine on the levels of Mollicutes and Butyricimonas may explain its robust antidepressant action.},

  abstract = {Although the robust antidepressant effects of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression are beyond doubt, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects remain unknown. NMDAR inhibition and the subsequent α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation are suggested to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Although (R)-ketamine is a less potent NMDAR antagonist than (S)-ketamine, (R)-ketamine has shown more marked and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in several animal models of depression. Furthermore, non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists do not exhibit robust ketamine-like antidepressant effects in patients with depression. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than NMDAR inhibition play a key role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Duman’s group demonstrated that the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the medial prefrontal cortex is reportedly involved in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. However, we reported that mTORC1 serves a role in the antidepressant effects of (S)-ketamine, but not of (R)-ketamine, and that extracellular signal-regulated kinase possibly underlie the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), are crucial in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers, (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine, in rodents. In addition, (2R,6R)-hydroxynormetamine [a metabolite of (R)-ketamine] and (S)-norketamine [a metabolite of (S)-ketamine] have been shown to exhibit antidepressant-like effects on rodents through the BDNF–TrkB cascade. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites. It may be time to reconsider the hypothesis of NMDAR inhibition and the subsequent AMPAR activation in the antidepressant effects of ketamine.},

  abstract = {The goal of the present protocol is to describe the forced swim test (FST), which is one of the most commonly used assays for the study of depressive-like behavior in rodents. The FST is based on the assumption that when placing an animal in a container filled with water, it will first make efforts to escape but eventually will exhibit immobility that may be considered to reflect a measure of behavioral despair. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of the animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression. Additionally, the FST has been shown to share some of the factors that are influenced or altered by depression in humans, including changes in food consumption, sleep abnormalities and drug-withdrawal-induced anhedonia. The main advantages of this procedure are that it is relatively easy to perform and that its results are easily and quickly analyzed. Moreover, its sensitivity to a broad range of antidepressant drugs that makes it a suitable screening test is one of the most important features leading to its high predictive validity. Despite its appeal, this model has a number of disadvantages. First, the issue of chronic augmentation is problematic in this test because in real life patients need to be treated for at least several weeks before they experience any relief from their symptoms. Last, due to the aversiveness of the FST, it is important to take into account possible influences it might have on brain structure/function if brain analyses are to be carried out following this procedure.},

Modulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is suggested to mediate the antidepressant action of ketamine and of one of its metabolites (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK). We have examined whether ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK affect glutamatergic transmission and plasticity in the mesolimbic system, brain regions known to have key roles in reward-motivated behaviors, mood and hedonic drive. We found that one day after the injection of a low dose of ketamine, long-term potentiation (LTP) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was impaired. Loss of LTP was maintained for 7 days and was not associated with an altered basal synaptic transmission mediated by AMPARs and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling with rapamycin did not prevent the ketamine-induced loss of LTP but inhibited LTP in saline-treated mice. However, ketamine blunted the increase in the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs at a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/protein kinase C site induced by an LTP induction protocol. Moreover, ketamine caused a persistent increased phosphorylation of GluA1 at a protein kinase A site. (2R,6R)-HNK also impaired LTP in the NAc. In dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area from ketamine- or (2R,6R)-HNK-treated mice, AMPAR-mediated responses were depressed, while those mediated by NMDARs were unaltered, which resulted in a reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio, a measure of long-term synaptic depression. These results demonstrate that a single injection of ketamine or (2R,6R)-HNK induces enduring alterations in the function of AMPARs and synaptic plasticity in brain regions involved in reward-related behaviors.},

Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could activate BDNF transcription through activation of CREB as well as MeCP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) suppression in microglia. Single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CREB-DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotides (CREB-HDO) or BDNF exon IV-HDO blocked the antidepressant-like effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Moreover, microglial depletion by colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397 blocked the antidepressant-like effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. In addition, inhibition of microglia by single i.c.v. injection of mannosylated clodronate liposomes (MCLs) significantly blocked the antidepressant-like effects of (R)-ketamine in CSDS susceptible mice. Finally, single i.c.v. injection of CREB-HDO, BDNF exon IV-HDO or MCLs blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine on the reduced dendritic spine density in the mPFC of CSDS susceptible mice. These data suggest a novel ERK-NRBP1-CREB-BDNF pathways in microglia underlying antidepressant-like effects of (R)-ketamine.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the research evidence concerning the intergenerational transmission of trauma effects and the possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in this transmission. Two broad categories of epigenetically mediated effects are highlighted. The first involves developmentally programmed effects. These can result from the influence of the offspring's early environmental exposures, including postnatal maternal care as well as in utero exposure reflecting maternal stress during pregnancy. The second includes epigenetic changes associated with a preconception trauma in parents that may affect the germline, and impact fetoplacental interactions. Several factors, such as sex-specific epigenetic effects following trauma exposure and parental developmental stage at the time of exposure, explain different effects of maternal and paternal trauma. The most compelling work to date has been done in animal models, where the opportunity for controlled designs enables clear interpretations of transmissible effects. Given the paucity of human studies and the methodological challenges in conducting such studies, it is not possible to attribute inter-generational effects in humans to a single set of biological or other determinants at this time. Elucidating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in in-tergenerational effects through prospective, multi-generational studies may ultimately yield a cogent understanding of how individual, cultural and societal experiences permeate our biology. There is now converging evidence supporting the idea that offspring are affected by parental trauma exposures occurring before their birth, and possibly even prior to their conception. On the simplest level, the concept of intergenerational trauma acknowledges that exposure to extremely adverse events impacts individuals to such a great extent that their offspring find themselves grappling with their parents' post-traumatic state. A more recent and provocative claim is that the experience of trauma-or more accurately the effect of that experience is "passed" somehow from one generation to the next through non-genomic, possibly epigenetic mechanisms affecting DNA function or gene transcription 1-6. Although both intergenerational (from F0 to F1) and trans-generational (from F0 to F3 or F4) transmission of environmental adversity effects have been established in animal models , studies in humans have not yet demonstrated that the effects of trauma are heritable through non-genomic (i.e., epi-genetic) mechanisms. Nonetheless, there has been much excitement about, and even premature promulgation of, the idea that those effects are transmitted through DNA modifications, explaining the impact of familial experience 7. The inclination to attribute offspring effects to epigenetic mechanisms in part reflects the inexact and varied use of the term "transmission". The original use was descriptive, and without mechanistic inferences. Now that animal research has defined a molecular pathway through which transmission of trauma effects might occur, more precise language is warranted to distinguish between clinical observation and biological mechanism. At the current time, the idea that epigenetic mechanisms underlie clinical observations in offspring of trauma survivors represents a hypothesis to be tested. This review delineates potential epigenetic mechanisms that might be examined in relation to offspring effects, and provides insight into the type of studies that might be most informative. The concept of intergenerational trauma was introduced in the psychiatric literature through descriptions of behavioral and clinical problems in offspring of Holocaust survivors 8. In a pivotal paper describing three patients who presented for psychiatric treatment, Rakoff 8 wrote: "The parents are not broken conspicuously, yet their children, all of whom were born after the Holocaust, display severe psychiatric symptom-atology. It would almost be easier to believe that they, rather than their parents, had suffered the corrupting, searing hell". This initial report generated mostly negative reactions, including caution about generalizing from what might have been idiosyncratic observations in a small number of extreme cases 9. Some stakeholders may have felt that the suggestion that surviving the trauma of genocide had deleterious implications for progeny was stigmatizing in the face of the emerging cultural narrative regarding the Holocaust, which was one of survival against all odds, resilience, and defiance in the hope of preventing such occurrences in the future 10. The initial anecdotal report, and the reactions to it, generated much empirical research on the question of whether and how Holocaust offspring, conceived and born after World War II, were affected.

  abstract = {In recent years, striking new evidence has demonstrated non-genetic inheritance of acquired traits associated with parental environmental exposures. In particular, this transgenerational modulation of phenotypic traits is of direct relevance to psychiatric disorders, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Here we review the recent progress in this field, with an emphasis on acquired traits of psychiatric illnesses transmitted epigenetically via the male lineage. We discuss the transgenerational effects of paternal exposure to stress vs. positive stimuli, such as exercise, and discuss their impact on the behavioral, affective and cognitive characteristics of their progeny. Furthermore, we review the recent evidence suggesting that these transgenerational effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including changes in DNA methylation and small non-coding RNAs in the sperm. We discuss the urgent need for more research exploring transgenerational epigenetic effects in animal models and human populations. These future studies may identify epigenetic mechanisms as potential contributors to the ‘missing heritability’ observed in genome-wide association studies of psychiatric illnesses and other human disorders. This exciting new field of transgenerational epigenomics will facilitate the development of novel strategies to predict, prevent and treat negative epigenetic consequences on offspring health, and psychiatric disorders in particular.},

  abstract = {Depression is one of the leading causes of disability and a significant health-concern worldwide. Much of our current understanding on the pathogenesis of depression and the pharmacology of antidepressant drugs is based on pre-clinical models. Three of the most popular stress-based rodent models are the forced swimming test, the chronic mild stress paradigm and the learned helplessness model. Despite their recognizable advantages and limitations, they are associated with an immense variability due to the high number of design parameters that define them. Only few studies have reported how minor modifications of these parameters affect the model phenotype. Thus, the existing variability in how these models are used has been a strong barrier for drug development as well as benchmark and evaluation of these pre-clinical models of depression. It also has been the source of confusing variability in the experimental outcomes between research groups using the same models. In this review, we summarize the known variability in the experimental protocols, identify the main and relevant parameters for each model and describe the variable values using characteristic examples. Our view of depression and our efforts to discover novel and effective antidepressants is largely based on our detailed knowledge of these testing paradigms, and requires a sound understanding around the importance of individual parameters to optimize and improve these pre-clinical models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The emerging antidepressant effects of ketamine have inspired tremendous interest in its underlying neurobiological mechanisms, although the involvement of 5-HT in the antidepressant effects of ketamine remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The chronic restraint stress procedure was performed to induce depression-like behaviours in mice. OFT, FST, TST, and NSFT tests were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Tph2 knockout or depletion of 5-HT by PCPA and 5,7-DHT were used to manipulate the brain 5-HT system. ELISA and fibre photometry recordings were used to measure extracellular 5-HT levels in the brain. KEY RESULTS: 60\,min after injection, ketamine (10~mg·kg-1, i.p.) produced rapid antidepressant-like effects and increased brain 5-HT levels. After 24\,h, ketamine significantly reduced immobility time in TST and FST tests and increased brain 5-HT levels, as measured by ELISA and fibre photometry recordings. The sustained (24\,h) but not rapid (60\,min) antidepressant-like effects of ketamine were abrogated by PCPA and 5,7-DHT, or by Tph2 knockout. Importantly, NBQX (10~mg·kg-1, i.p.), an AMPA receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited the effect of ketamine on brain 5-HT levels and abolished the sustained antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in naïve or CRS-treated mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study confirms the requirement of serotonergic neurotransmission for the sustained antidepressant-like effects of ketamine, which appears to involve AMPA receptors, and provides avenues to search for antidepressant pharmacological targets.},

Here we characterize a novel chronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS) paradigm that results in comparable stress effects in both sexes. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were simultaneously introduced into the home cage of resident CD-1 aggressors for 10 daily 5-min sessions. CD-1 aggressors attacked males and females indiscriminately, resulting in stress resilient and susceptible subpopulations in both sexes. CD-1 aggressors attacked C57BL/6J male intruders faster and more frequently than female intruders. However, CNSDS similarly induced negative valence behaviors in SUS mice of both sexes relative to RES and CNTRL mice. Furthermore, SUS male and female mice displayed similar increases in plasma corticosterone levels following CNSDS exposure relative to pre-stress exposure levels. The estrous cycle did not impact CD-1 attack behavior or negative valence behaviors. Thus, CNSDS induces chronic stress behavioral and neuroendocrine effects in both male and female C57BL/6J mice and allows direct comparisons between sexes. Adoption of this modified social defeat paradigm will help advance the initiative to include female rodents in preclinical chronic stress research.},

The present project used Monte Carlo simulation to compare the relative strengths of the traditional approach with both linear and nonlinear mixed effects modeling that identifies the learning function for each animal and condition. Both trend-based mixed effects modeling approaches showed much greater sensitivity to identifying real effects, and the nonlinear approach provided uniformly better fits of learning trends. The common practice of removing a rat from the maze after 90 s, however, proved more problematic for the nonlinear approach and produced an underestimate of y-axis intercepts.

The present study revisits their conclusions by considering a new approach that involves multilevel (i.e., mixed effects) censored generalized linear regression using Bayesian analysis. A censored regression explicitly models the censoring created by prematurely ending a trial, and the use of generalized linear regression incorporates the skewed distribution of latency data as well as the nonlinear relationships this can produce.

In some cases it may be desirable to flexibly adjust behavioral responses depending on the cues that vary from one episode to the next. In others, successful navigation might be achieved with inflexible, habit-like responses that reduce cognitive load. Adult neurogenesis is believed to contribute to the spatial processing functions of the hippocampus, particularly when behavioral flexibility is required. However, little is known about the role of neurogenesis in spatial navigation when goals are unpredictable or change repeatedly according to certain rules. We hypothesized that neurogenesis is necessary in a spatial navigation task that involves different patterns of reinforcement. Intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats were trained to escape to one of two possible platform locations in a spatial water maze. The platform either repeated in the same location for all trials in a day, alternated between two locations across trials, or randomly moved between the two locations. Neurogenesis selectively enhanced escape performance in the alternating condition, but not by improving platform choice accuracy. Instead, neurogenesis-intact rats made fewer search errors and developed an efficient habit-like strategy where they consistently swam to a preferred location. If the platform was not present, they proceeded to the other possible location. In contrast, neurogenesis-deficient rats were indecisive and navigationally less-efficient. Thus, in conditions where goals follow a predictable spatiotemporal pattern, adult neurogenesis promotes the adoption of navigation strategies that are spatially nonspecific but, nonetheless, accurate and efficient.},

Chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS) destroys synaptic plasticity of hippocampal regenerated neurons that may be involved in the occurrence of poststroke depression. Astrocytes uptake glutamate at the synapse and provide metabolic support for neighboring neurons. Currently, we aim to investigate whether CUMS inhibits synaptic formation of regenerated neurons through a glutamate transporter, GLT-1, of astrocytes in the ischemic stroke rats. Method. We exposed the ischemic stroke rats to ceftriaxone, during the CUMS intervention period to determine the effects of GLT-1 on glutamate circulation by immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry and its influences to synaptic plasticity by western blot and transmission electron microscopy. Result. CUMS evidently reduced the level of astroglial GLT-1 in the hippocampus of the ischemic rats (p {$<$} 0 05), resulting in smaller amount of glutamate being transported into astrocytes surrounding synapses (p {$<$} 0 05), and then expression of synaptophysin was suppressed (p {$<$} 0 05) in hippocampal dentate gyrus. The ultrastructures of synapses in dentate gyrus were adversely influenced including decreased proportion of smile synapses, shortened thickness of postsynaptic density, reduced number of vesicles, and widened average distance of the synaptic cleft (all p {$<$} 0 05). Moreover, ceftriaxone can promote glutamate circulation and synaptic plasticity (all p {$<$} 0 05) by raising astroglial GLT-1 (p {$<$} 0 05) and then improve depressive behaviors of the CUMS-induced model rats (p {$<$} 0 05). Conclusion. Our study shows that CUMS destroys synaptic plasticity of regenerated neurons in the hippocampus through a glutamate transporter, GLT-1, of astrocytes in the ischemic stroke rats.

  abstract = {Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) showed an increased risk of anxiety. High anxiety levels are also shown to increase stress of diabetic patients, which may contribute to poor clinical outcomes. The mechanisms underlying the development of anxiety disorders in diabetic patients remain unknown. As a result, there are no available treatments yet. Here, we tested the hypothesis that glial cells in the hippocampal area of DM mice might be responsible for their anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, we postulated that treatment with antidepressant, fluoxetine, could reduce anxiety behaviors and prevent the dysregulation of glial cells (oligodendrocyte and astrocyte) in DM mice. Diabetic mice were administered a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ), followed by treatment with fluoxetine. Mice were then tested on Y maze, open field, dark and light transition, and elevated plus maze tests to measure the status of anxiety and cognition. After completing these behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed and western blot was used to detect the oligodendrocyte and astrocyte maker proteins in hippocampal tissues. Emphasis was directed towards adult oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and their marker protein to measure their proliferation and differentiation. We found that fluoxetine could effectively mitigate the level of anxiety and attenuate the cognitive dysfunction in diabetic mice. Meanwhile, fluoxetine inhibited astrocyte activation in mice exposed to STZ, prevented the loss of myelin basic protein (MBP), and affected the function of OPCs in these diabetic mice. The results suggested that the changes of these glial cells in the brains of diabetic mice might be related to the high anxiety levels and cognitive deficit in DM mice. Fluoxetine could ameliorate the high anxiety level and prevent cognitive deficit via inhibiting astrocyte activation and repairing the oligodendrocyte damage.},

Besides its well known neuroprotective activity after traumatic brain injury the evidences regarding its activity dependent release by the pathophysiology of major depression are rapidly replicating. Considering the data that stress plays an important role by the development of depression which is characterized with prominent hippocampal cell death, as well as the well known neuroprotective effects of BDNF, we aimed to investigate the link between the BDNF, stress and depression.

  abstract = {A detailed protocol is described to induce chronic stress in BALB/c mice, which affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The protocol is based on a combination of two mild physical stressors: restraint stress and forced swimming. Physical stressors were applied on an alternative schedule: one day restraint, next day swimming, during a 28-day period. Mice were sacrificed at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 and plasma was obtained. Optimized chromatographic system with electrochemical detection and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit were used to measure catecholamines [representative of the activation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)] and corticosterone (representative of the activation of the HPA axis). Corticosterone levels increased in mice under stress and remained significantly higher in stressed mice compared to control animals throughout the experimental procedure, indicating that mice did not show habituation to the combined stress. In our experimental conditions, catecholamine levels were not useful as an index of stress. The stress model applied here provoked a steady activation of the HPA axis resulting in the constant secretion of corticosterone from the adrenal gland, which may prevent the activation of the ANS axis. The simple and economic stress model presented here affected the HPA axis but not the ANS of BALB/c mice and is useful for the study of metabolic stress-related gastric pathology and stress hormone secretion in mice.},

  abstract = {Introduction Axonal transport deficit is a key mechanism involved in neurodegenerative conditions. Fluoxetine, a commonly used antidepressant for treatment of depression, is known to regulate several important structural and neurochemical aspects of hippocampal functions. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on axonal transport in the hippocampus of rat stress-induced model of depression. Methods We have analyzed the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment (20~mg/kg/day, 24 days) on immobility behavior (forced swimming test), hippocampal iNOS (inflammatory factor) expression (RT-PCR) as well as hippocampal BDNF, kinesin and dynein expression (RT-PCR) and hippocampal neuronal survival (Nissl staining). Results This study provided evidence that fluoxetine could effectively suppress iNOS expression following unpredictable chronic mild stress (P {$<$} 0.01), increase hippocampal BDNF (P {$<$} 0.01), kinesin (P {$<$} 0.05) and dynein (P {$<$} 0.01) gene expression, and control neuronal death in CA1 (P {$<$} 0.01) and CA3 regions (P {$<$} 0.01) of the hippocampus and thereby improve immobility behavior (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, we concluded the neuroprotective effect of fluoxetine may be due to its ability to improve axonal transmission, followed by increased energy supply and neurotrophin concentration and function.},

  abstract = {Reorganization of cortical representations after focal visual cortex lesions has been documented. It has been suggested that functional reorganization may rely on cellular mechanisms involving modifications in the excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission balance and on morphological changes of neurons peripheral to the lesion. We explored functional reorganization of cortical retinotopic maps after a focal ischemic lesion in primary visual cortex of kittens using optical imaging of intrinsic signals. After 1, 2, and 5 weeks postlesion (wPL), we addressed whether functional reorganization correlated in time with changes in the expression of MAP-2, GAP-43, GFAP, GABAA receptor subunit α1 (GABAAα1), subunit 1 of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR1), and in neurotransmitter levels at the border of the lesion. Our results show that: (1) retinotopic maps reorganize with time after an ischemic lesion; (2) MAP-2 levels increase gradually from 1wPL to 5wPL; (3) MAP-2 upregulation is associated with an increase in dendritic-like structures surrounding the lesion and a decrease in GFAP-positive cells; (4) GAP-43 levels reach the highest point at 2wPL; (5) NMDAR1 and glutamate contents increase in parallel from 1wPL to 5wPL; (6) GABAAα1 levels increase from 1wPL to 2wPL but do not change after this time point; and (7) GABA contents remain low from 1wPL to 5wPL. This is a comprehensive study showing for the first time that functional reorganization correlates in time with dendritic sprouting and with changes in the excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission systems previously proposed to participate in cortical remodeling and suggests mechanisms by which plasticity of cortical representations may occur.},

The prototypical synapse-organizing complex neurexin-neuroligin mediates synapse development and function and is central to a shared genetic risk pathway in autism and schizophrenia. Neurexin's role in synapse development is thought to be mediated purely by its protein domains, but we reveal a requirement for a rare glycan modification. Mice lacking heparan sulfate (HS) on neurexin-1 show reduced survival, as well as structural and functional deficits at central synapses. HS directly binds postsynaptic partners neuroligins and LRRTMs, revealing a dual binding mode involving intrinsic glycan and protein domains for canonical synapse-organizing complexes. Neurexin HS chains also bind novel ligands, potentially expanding the neurexin interactome to hundreds of HS-binding proteins. Because HS structure is heterogeneous, our findings indicate an additional dimension to neurexin diversity, provide a molecular basis for fine-tuning synaptic function, and open therapeutic directions targeting glycan-binding motifs critical for brain development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A crosstalk exists between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and diabetic encephalopathy displays AD-like disorders. Sarsasapogenin (Sar) has  strong anti-inflammatory efficacy, showing neuroprotection and memory-enhancement  effects. PURPOSE: This study aims to verify the ameliorative effects of Sar on  diabetic encephalopathy in vivo and in vitro, and to clarify the mechanisms from  attenuation of AD-like pathology. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic  rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells were used in this study. After Sar  treatment (20 and 60 mg/kg) for consecutive 9 weeks, Morris water maze and novel  object recognition tasks were performed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for  examining loss of neurons in CA1 area and ki67 expression for reflecting  neurogenesis in DG area of hippocampus. Aβ production pathway and tau  phosphorylation kinase cascade were examined in these two models. RESULTS: Sar  improved learning and memory ability, loss of neurons and reduction of  neurogenesis in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Moreover, Sar suppressed Aβ  overproduction due to up-regulation of BACE1 in protein and mRNA and tau  hyperphosphorylation from inactivation of AKT/GSK-3β cascade in the hippocampus  and cerebral cortex of diabetic rats and high glucose-cultured SH-SY5Y cells, and  PPARγ antagonism abolished the effects of Sar on key molecules in the two  pathways. Additionally, it was found that high glucose-stimulated Aβ  overproduction was prior to tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. CONCLUSION: Sar  alleviated diabetic encephalopathy, which was obtained through inhibitions of Aβ  overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation mediated by the activation of PPARγ  signaling. Hence, Sar is a good candidate compound for AD-like disorders.},

  abstract = {Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that is associated with aging and contributes to increased mortality and morbidity. The overall prevalence of geriatric depression with clinically significant symptoms is currently on the rise. Recent studies have demonstrated that altered expressions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the brain affect neurodevelopment and manifest modulating functions during the depression. However, most lncRNAs have not yet been studied. Herein, we analyzed the transcriptome of dysregulated lncRNAs to reveal their expressions in a mouse model exhibiting depressive-like behaviors, as well as their corresponding response following antidepressant fluoxetine treatment. A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model was applied. A six-week fluoxetine intervention in CUMS-induced mice attenuated depressive-like behaviors. In addition, differential expression analysis of lncRNAs was performed following RNA-sequencing. A total of 282 lncRNAs (134 up-regulated and 148 down-regulated) were differentially expressed in CUMS-induced mice relative to non-stressed counterparts (P{$<$}0.05). Moreover, 370 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in CUMS-induced mice after fluoxetine intervention. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses showed an association between significantly dysregulated lncRNAs and protein binding, oxygen binding, and transport activity, while the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that these dysregulated lncRNAs might be involved in inflammatory response pathways. Fluoxetine effectively ameliorated the symptoms of depression in CUMS-induced mice by regulating the expression of lncRNAs in the hippocampus. The findings herein provide valuable insights into the potential mechanism underlying depression in elderly people.},

The number and properties of newly born neurons are regulatable by a broad range of physiological and pathological conditions. To begin to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms and functional relevance of adult neurogenesis, many studies rely on quantification of adult-born neurons. However, lack of standardized methods to quantify new neurons is impeding research reproducibility across laboratories. Here, we review the importance of stereology, and propose why and how it should be applied to the study of adult neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {Ketamine exerts fast acting, robust, and lasting antidepressant effects in a sub-anesthetic dose, however, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Recent studies have suggested that ketamine's antidepressant effects are probably attributed to the activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. The present study aimed to observe the effects of AMPA receptor modulators on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression during the procedure of ketamine exerting antidepressant effects. Therefore, we pretreated rats with NBQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist, or CX546, an AMPA receptor agonist, and subsequently observed the immobility time during the forced swimming test (FST) and the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical levels of mTOR and BDNF. The results showed ketamine decreased the immobility time of rats during the FST and increased the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical mTOR and BDNF. NBQX pretreatment significantly increased the immobility time and decreased the levels of mTOR and BDNF when compared with vehicle 1 (DMSO) pretreatment. CX546 pretreatment significantly decreased the immobility time and increased the levels of mTOR and BDNF when compared with vehicle 2 (DMSO. +. ethanol) pretreatment. Our results suggest ketamine-induced antidepressant effects are associated with AMPA receptors-mediated upregulation of mTOR and BDNF in rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents. Antidepressants, psychotherapies, and their combination are often used in routine clinical practice; however, available evidence on the comparative efficacy and safety of these interventions is inconclusive. Therefore, we sought to compare and rank all available treatment interventions for the acute treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. METHODS: We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ProQuest, CINAHL, LiLACS, international trial registries, and the websites of regulatory agencies for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials from database inception until Jan 1, 2019. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 16 antidepressants, seven psychotherapies, and five combinations of antidepressant and psychotherapy that are used for the acute treatment of children and adolescents (≤18 years old and of both sexes) with depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. Trials recruiting participants with treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, treatment duration of less than 4 weeks, or an overall sample size of fewer than ten patients were excluded. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy of outcome measures, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using validated methods. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in depressive symptoms) and acceptability (treatment discontinuation due to any cause). We estimated summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with credible intervals (CrIs) using network meta-analysis with random effects. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020841. FINDINGS: From 20\hphantom{,}366 publications, we included 71 trials (9510 participants). Depressive disorders in most studies were moderate to severe. In terms of efficacy, fluoxetine plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was more effective than CBT alone (-0·78, 95\% CrI -1·55 to -0·01) and psychodynamic therapy (-1·14, -2·20 to -0·08), but not more effective than fluoxetine alone (-0·22, -0·86 to 0·42). No pharmacotherapy alone was more effective than psychotherapy alone. Only fluoxetine plus CBT and fluoxetine were significantly more effective than pill placebo or psychological controls (SMDs ranged from -1·73 to -0·51); and only interpersonal therapy was more effective than all psychological controls (-1·37 to -0·66). Nortriptyline (SMDs ranged from 1·04 to 2·22) and waiting list (SMDs ranged from 0·67 to 2·08) were less effective than most active interventions. In terms of acceptability, nefazodone and fluoxetine were associated with fewer dropouts than sertraline, imipramine, and desipramine (ORs ranged from 0·17 to 0·50); imipramine was associated with more dropouts than pill placebo, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine plus CBT, and vilazodone (2·51 to 5·06). Most of the results were rated as "low" to "very low" in terms of confidence of evidence according to Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis. INTERPRETATION: Despite the scarcity of high-quality evidence, fluoxetine (alone or in combination with CBT) seems to be the best choice for the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depressive disorder in children and adolescents. However, the effects of these interventions might vary between individuals, so patients, carers, and clinicians should carefully balance the risk-benefit profile of efficacy, acceptability, and suicide risk of all active interventions in young patients with depression on a case-by-case basis.

Little is known about the molecular characteristics of adult human hippocampal imGCs, and even their existence is under debate1,6-8. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing aided by a validated machine learning-based analytic approach to identify imGCs and quantify their abundance in the human hippocampus at different stages across the lifespan. We identified common molecular hallmarks of human imGCs across the lifespan and observed age-dependent transcriptional dynamics in human imGCs that suggest changes in cellular functionality, niche interactions and disease relevance, that differ from those in mice9. We also found a decreased number of imGCs with altered gene expression in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we demonstrated the capacity for neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus with the presence of rare dentate granule cell fate-specific proliferating neural progenitors and with cultured surgical specimens. Together, our findings suggest the presence of a substantial number of imGCs in the adult human hippocampus via low-frequency de novo generation and protracted maturation, and our study reveals their molecular properties across the lifespan and in Alzheimer's disease.},

Behavioral testing performed included forced-swimming, tail suspension, open-field and elevated plus-maze tests. In addition, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine levels, and mRNA and protein expressions related to 5-HT synthesis, transport, and signaling were analyzed in the hippocampus of tested animals. Results: Our results revealed that each model demonstrated a specific profile of markers, whereas the stability of them differed over testing time. Conclusions: Each model provided a unique set of advantages that can be considered depending on the context and aims of each study. Among the three models, the UCMS model was mostly stable and appeared to the best model for testing long-term depression-like state.},

Our tests revealed ChatGPT’s nearly barrier-free image generation feature can be used to generate experimental result images, such as blood smears, Western Blot, immunofluorescence and so on. Although the current ability of ChatGPT to generate experimental images is limited, the risk of misuse is evident. This development underscores the need for immediate action. We suggest that AI providers restrict the generation of experimental image, develop tools to detect AI-generated images, and consider adding “invisible watermarks” to the generated images. By implementing these measures, we can better ensure the responsible use of AI technology in academic research and maintain the integrity of scientific evidence.},

Yet the damage in these cases has not usually been confined to the hippocampus, and the status of memory functions has often been based on incomplete neuropsychological information. Thus, the human cases have until now left some uncertainty as to whether lesions limited to the hippocampus are sufficient to cause amnesia. Here we report a case of amnesia in a patient (R.B.) who developed memory impairment following an ischemic episode. During the 5 years until his death, R.B. exhibited marked anterograde amnesia, little if any retrograde amnesia, and showed no signs of cognitive impairment other than memory. Thorough histological examination revealed a circumscribed bilateral lesion involving the entire CA1 field of the hippocampus. Minor pathology was found elsewhere in the brain (e.g., left globus pallidus, right postcentral gyrus, left internal capsule), but the only damage that could be reasonably associated with the memory defect was the lesion in the hippocampus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of amnesia following a lesion limited to the hippocampus in which extensive neuropsychological and neuropathological analyses have been carried out.},

Currently, automated tracking and analysis programs of rodent moving are becoming to be popular. Thus, our goal was to develop and create an available quality product, which will allow the scientist to carry out research as efficiently as possible doing various options of the “Morris water maze” using latest modern parameters. In this article, we analyze different types of the Morris water maze methodology and the current scientific parameters of this test to understand the necessary and optimal capabilities of the future program, then to overcome the limitations of the systems currently available we have combined detection and tracking techniques into one standalone tool. The result of the work is a software product that allows to quickly and accurately detect the trajectory of animal moving in the water, and also provides parameters for evaluating the cognitive functions of memory and learning.},
